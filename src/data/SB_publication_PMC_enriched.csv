After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in 
space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 
19-May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project 
was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the 
experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice 
experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular 
mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term 
exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, 
both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure 
measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return 
of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in 
space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on 
ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing 
conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for 
housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the 
co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The 
measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the 
peculiarities of ""space"" paste food are described. The training program for mice 
designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional 
test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The 
results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous 
groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and 
displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of 
the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our 
training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed 
in space biomedical research.

Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical 
stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in 
bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, 
osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of 
their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause 
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic 
osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to 
bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female 
C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle 
mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction 
(BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered 
trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), 
indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies 
revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional 
area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter 
(+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in 
bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, 
+2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, 
and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression 
of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to 
osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as 
well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis 
inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by -1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated 
with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our 
findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an 
active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is 
not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new 
evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated 
osteogenic cell cycle arrest.

Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique 
environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human 
cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes 
and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the 
immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine 
production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility 
to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in 
cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor 
dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, 
microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, 
including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into 
hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity 
induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone 
mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, 
and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human 
pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced 
mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural 
maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These 
advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting 
promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as 
myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of 
microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its 
potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and 
immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of 
microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space 
missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications 
on Earth.

Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor 
cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell 
differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies 
have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing 
technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell 
proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of 
stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity 
conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were 
bound to microspheres (100-300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. 
One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the 
proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in 
their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These 
cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, 
NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony 
formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We 
believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative 
therapies using hASCs.

The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to 
studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing 
new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving 
these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based 
laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple 
microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of 
molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, 
uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples 
for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic 
RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized 
PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the 
results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity 
during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a 
concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse 
Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified 
on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold 
(Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were 
similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene 
expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was 
successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of 
experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping 
of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable 
increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully 
suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to 
pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab-2 
facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for 
molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench 
experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.

Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced 
redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac 
deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and 
oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac 
changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis 
that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response 
pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended 
spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth 
(ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We 
measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and 
Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 
genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated 
transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2, 
suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. 
Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell 
cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc, and downregulated the inflammatory response 
gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53. 
Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle 
and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to 
cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.

Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. 
Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term 
influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and 
possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that 
ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, 
with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks 
old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) 
protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 
cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA's Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or 
one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed 
tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. 
Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture 
conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or 
mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging 
mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of 
either 56Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. 
Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type 
or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks 
and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few 
changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high 
dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the 
damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but 
had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either 
protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, 
whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a 
limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not 
elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET 
irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state 
gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which 
may contribute to persistent bone loss.

One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to 
cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and 
mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a 
precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate 
machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex 
vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method 
has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining 
plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to 
ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific 
micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force 
levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. 
To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups (n = 5-6 per 
group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against 
two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the 
mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In 
particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the 
measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; 
p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing 
of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.

Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range 
of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to 
sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been 
attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of 
collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains 
unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material 
without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on 
excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, 
C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 
0 (control), 50, 1000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen 
fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and 
cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group 
differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for 
collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic 
strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 
73% respectively, (p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1000 Gy was not different than the 
control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 
17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was 
greater than control for all radiation doses (p < 0.001). All results were 
consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that 
the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex 
vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen 
backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.

BACKGROUND: The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is located at the 
sarcolemma of muscle fibers, providing structural integrity. Mutations in and 
loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the 
sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, 
but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs 
not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of 
normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We 
extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent 
ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered 
with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan.
METHODS: We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of 
γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles 
from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG(-/-)) mice. All were subjected 
to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by 
immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium 
dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or 
tetracaine-supplemented Ringer's solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by 
stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin.
RESULTS: C2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but 
decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive 
stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary 
cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG(-/-) cultures displayed no p70S6K 
response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. 
Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG(-/-) mice, in a 
calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 
and γ-SG(-/-) isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG(-/-) muscles, unlike 
the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K 
activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP 
phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K 
activation in stretched γ-SG(-/-) muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained 
elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent 
mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of 
γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that 
γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert 
that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the 
sarcoglycans are absent.

BACKGROUND: Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, 
regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling. Many Rab-like 
proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been functionally 
characterized.
RESULTS: Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in 
pollen development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c 
single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type 
plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is 
also indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however 
its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type 
plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched 
pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were 
found to be primarily due to the pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have 
different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both highly 
expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi 
bodies.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and 
AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking during pollen tube growth that cannot be 
fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.

TNO1 is involved in salt tolerance and vacuolar trafficking in Arabidopsis.

The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor 
attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the 
trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These 
proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole 
biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named 
TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by 
coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize 
to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased 
sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to 
mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the 
salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were 
partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is 
required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had 
delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon 
application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the 
mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment 
upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar 
trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in 
maintaining TGN structure or identity.

SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the 
present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized 
Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans-Golgi 
network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of 
its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this 
novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) and 
predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of 
Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity 
to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a 
membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single 
transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino 
acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should 
localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi. 
As single atgtlp-/- mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary 
root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high 
similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions.

BACKGROUND: The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability 
to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient 
acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing 
external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. 
Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic 
waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in 
identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a 
trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.
RESULTS: We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized 
SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the 
trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display 
enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots 
increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule 
destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell 
morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the 
mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent 
of the orientation of microtubule arrays.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is 
dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of 
microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell 
morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The 
TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate 
epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.

The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay 
station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and 
trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a 
large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane 
fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein 
trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin 
transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, 
decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the 
auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic 
acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was 
reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin 
transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots 
exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal 
cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk 
endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together 
these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during 
root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin 
transport proteins.

Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several 
cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are 
crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog 
of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously 
named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear 
attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the 
testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the 
germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment 
of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and 
centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This 
role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH 
proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the 
coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of 
localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and 
epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are 
downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in 
spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they 
could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface.

Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but 
requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term 
exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space 
travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased 
vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In 
addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further 
challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to 
design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate 
immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. 
Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling 
pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal 
infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These 
results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which 
flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune 
responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone 
altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. 
Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. 
In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. 
We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat 
shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight 
have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related 
transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a 
Toll-mediated infection response.

Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts' 
cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify 
datasets within NASA's GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we 
used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for 
the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge 
can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific 
pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up 
for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe 
were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the 
International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between 
simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN 
is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: 
the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be 
transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic 
signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight 
signature than 56Fe's signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time 
GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that 
the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of 
omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine 
animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate 
human risk in space.

Omics data sharing is crucial to the biological research community, and the last 
decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems, databases, 
and knowledge bases for omics and other systems biology data. We assessed the 
""FAIRness"" of NASA's GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) along with four similar kinds 
of systems in the research omics data domain, using 14 FAIRness metrics. The 
range of overall FAIRness scores was 6-12 (out of 14), average 10.1, and 
standard deviation 2.4. The range of Pass ratings for the metrics was 29-79%, 
Partial Pass 0-21%, and Fail 7-50%. The systems we evaluated performed the best 
in the areas of data findability and accessibility, and worst in the area of 
data interoperability. Reusability of metadata, in particular, was frequently 
not well supported. We relate our experiences implementing semantic integration 
of omics data from some of the assessed systems for federated querying and 
retrieval functions, given their shortcomings in data interoperability. Finally, 
we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, 
should consider for maximizing data accessibility.

Background: Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is one of the 
major risk factors that will impact the health of astronauts on extended 
missions outside the protective effects of the Earth's magnetic field. The NASA 
GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal 
models with curated dosimetry information for spaceflight experiments. Methods: 
We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based 
and spaceflight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. 
A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for 
ground studies, as well as samples flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total 
doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were 
able to identify distinct biological signatures associating specific ions with 
specific biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, 
we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune 
pathways as a function of dose. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the 
GeneLab's rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to 
generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR 
exposures.

We have identified and validated a spaceflight-associated microRNA (miRNA) 
signature that is shared by rodents and humans in response to simulated, 
short-duration and long-duration spaceflight. Previous studies have identified 
miRNAs that regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit, and we 
have confirmed the expression of these proposed spaceflight-associated miRNAs in 
rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions. Moreover, astronaut 
samples from the NASA Twins Study confirmed these expression signatures in miRNA 
sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell assay for 
transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data. Additionally, a subset of 
these miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) was found to regulate vascular damage 
caused by simulated deep space radiation. To demonstrate the physiological 
relevance of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs, we utilized antagomirs to 
inhibit their expression and successfully rescue simulated 
deep-space-radiation-mediated damage in human 3D vascular constructs.

BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human 
health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space 
habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for 
long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for 
investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The 
shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking-1 
(MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three 
flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. 
The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole 
genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs 
retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium 
monoazide (PMA; viable microbes).
RESULTS: We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to 
go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and 
extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed 
AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to 
urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated 
from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many 
isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of 
Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were 
experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, 
showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed 
the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses 
demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR 
determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS 
environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans. Video

Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing 
radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant 
hazards to the health of astronauts. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an 
impact on established cancer hallmarks, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. 
Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, 
largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, 
historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space 
than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and 
radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. 
The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out 
related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies 
are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as 
postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration 
spaceflight.

and their relationships in response to space exposure have never been studied. 
We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on NASA 
RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceflight using GSEA, ORA, and 
sparse partial least square-differential analysis. We found that lipid 
metabolism is the most affected biological process between the two organs. A 
specific gene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with 
glucose sparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand 
process gene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the 
muscle. Our results show that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the 
liver and muscle atrophy gene expression are two paired events during 
spaceflight, for which dietary changes represent a possible countermeasure.

Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of 
prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health 
remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant 
changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering 
epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work 
by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated 
spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET 
(X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic 
architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our 
results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and 
JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56Fe induces a persistent DNA 
methylation increase whereas 28Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation 
which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear 
chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our 
study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as 
well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic 
radiation damage.

COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused significant morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health 
implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and 
sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the 
biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context 
of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge 
and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on 
the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of 
COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 
effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide 
innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.

Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts' health, leading to 
molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These 
alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased 
inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. 
Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging 
process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these 
molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty 
syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been 
comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, 
we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA's GeneLab, along with astronaut data 
gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess 
the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and 
sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified 
notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the 
development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings 
suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend 
to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the 
utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be 
warranted.

Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with 
spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure 
treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. Here, we expand on 
this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure 
treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D 
microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of 
Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: 
miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p (i.e., antagomirs). Significant reduction 
of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of 
mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from 
astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, 
we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs 
are altered in humans. Our findings indicate a countermeasure strategy that can 
potentially be utilized by astronauts in spaceflight missions to mitigate space 
radiation damage.

sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of 
space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy 
and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, 
we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for 
selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, 
especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space 
operations.

While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after 
spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are 
many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex 
environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only 
is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are 
significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. 
In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was 
significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the 
International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased 
virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial 
cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in 
bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground 
using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria 
was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for 
the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to 
the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor 
contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected 
with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later 
timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in 
vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes 
occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel 
mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.

Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to 
exploration of low-earth orbit, the moon, and beyond. Drosophila can be sent to 
space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure 
and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies 
reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling 
and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed 
reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and 
dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed 
compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was 
examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated 
proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. 
Remarkably, in long-QT causing sei/hERG mutants, proteasomal gene expression at 
1g, although less than the wild-type expression, was nevertheless increased in 
microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a 
fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.

Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out 
for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation 
and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal 
transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic 
network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and 
hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation 
highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth 
and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting 
drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop 
between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell 
division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark 
upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of 
cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein 
trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is 
shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large 
gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their 
developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on 
primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light 
and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. 
The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, 
homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception 
of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it 
is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin 
transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can 
affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback 
loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, 
although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies 
with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and 
organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains 
a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and 
therefore root growth.

The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the 
proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely 
uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the 
HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a 
forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened 
sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific 
tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded 
by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans-Golgi network 
(TGN)/early endosome (EE) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that 
it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was 
found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange 
factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING 
DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild 
root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1, and 
analyses of ahlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 
operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 
together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of 
the TGN/EE at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants.

When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. 
This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant 
hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown 
to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots 
exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize 
that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on 
filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic 
responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and 
eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with 
controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects 
of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a 
slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, 
a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was 
withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in 
chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. 
Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was 
also observed in living roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seedlings 
expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, 
eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with 
those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global 
F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with 
eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and 
LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited 
autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by 
modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.

Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a well-characterized second messenger in 
eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca2+]cyt levels is one of the earliest 
responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. 
Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cyt in plant development has been 
facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of 
these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (35S) 
and Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. 
Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit 
unique [Ca2+]cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few 
studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis 
thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the 
columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found 
similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cyt signature among these root cell 
types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and 
salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cyt increases in root cells. These cell 
type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in 
depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to 
specific root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt.

Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient 
and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining 
growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and 
endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known 
about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this 
process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi 
domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, 
subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display 
polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct 
developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi 
compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused 
vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other 
hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair 
emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced in spi 
and the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in brk1 and scar1234. BRK1 
depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from 
initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in 
facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through 
pathways that might intersect with W/SC.

Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique 
environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and 
immune systems. However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this 
stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of 
three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 
1 g) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25-35 days in 
the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity 
was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g. Both 1 g and 
1/6 g suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast 
marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half 
recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g, but gene expression changes were not fully 
recovered by 1/6 g. While no histological changes were observed due to low 
gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that 
in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological 
alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study 
highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as 
an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for 
maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight.

While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the 
best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein 
can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric 
state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, 
two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL 
have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel 
(MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. 
Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is 
a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the 
structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a 
disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL 
channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant 
and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified 
SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches 
(sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) 
and established that SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and 
C(8)E(5) detergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL 
solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed 
the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further 
demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional 
detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric 
organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can 
alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in 
vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein's true 
functionally relevant oligomeric state.

MscL is a bacterial mechanosensor that serves as a biological emergency release 
valve, releasing cytoplasmic solutes to the environment on osmotic downshock. 
Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it 
ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release 
devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the 
introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the 
absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge 
on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of 
the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities 
have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only 
encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the 
permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important 
implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used 
in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction 
of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of 
charged molecules. These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, 
surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the 
membrane.

The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from E. coli serves as 
an emergency release valve allowing the cell to survive acute osmotic downshock. 
It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm 
for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal 
structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved 
showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies 
followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a 
species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for 
crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. 
aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to 
play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic 
helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the 
C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in 
native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that 
the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, 
including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal 
structure, are pentamers in vivo. Thus, the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus 
protein only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein 
when it is solubilized in detergent.

MscL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that protects cells from lysis upon 
acute decrease in external osmotic environment. It is one of the best 
characterized mechanosensors known, thus serving as a paradigm of how such 
molecules sense and respond to stimuli. In addition, the fact that it can be 
genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its 
proposed use as a triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors 
within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug 
release. X-ray crystallography reveals a homopentameric complex with each 
subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single 
carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a 5-fold 
cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this 
study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the 
linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by 
either cross-linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel 
is reduced; in the later two cases, even reversibly. While they have 
implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for 
engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices.

The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the 
best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how 
proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of 
MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden 
drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state 
of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two 
transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an 
iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An 
N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and 
the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2(ci)), are relatively 
close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we 
determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how 
these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 
double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide 
bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two 
regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and 
show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the 
results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL 
gating.

Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps 
one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur 
is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily 
translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up 
within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell 
will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both 
families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as 
biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be 
jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these 
proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles 
and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic 
interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and 
contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential 
physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the 
current models for their structure and function.

MscL, the highly conserved bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large 
conductance, serves as an osmotic ""emergency release valve,"" is among the 
best-studied mechanosensors, and is a paradigm of how a channel senses and 
responds to membrane tension. Although all homologs tested thus far encode 
channel activity, many show functional differences. We tested Escherichia coli 
and Staphylococcus aureus chimeras and found that the periplasmic region of the 
protein, particularly E. coli I49 and the equivalent S. aureus F47 at the 
periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, 
drastically influences both the open dwell time and the threshold of channel 
opening. One mutant shows a severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this 
residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating. We propose that 
this site acts similarly to a spring for a clasp knife, adjusting the resistance 
for obtaining and stabilizing an open or closed channel structure.

Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental 
stresses, express a unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-specific 
intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are often expressed at high 
levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation. 
Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade 
proteins termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (""SAHS"") proteins, and 
investigate their ability to protect diverse biological structures. 
Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins prevent desiccated liposomes from fusion, 
and enhance desiccation tolerance of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici upon 
extracellular application. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative 
structural analysis suggest a model by which SAHS proteins may undergo a 
structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water and solutes 
from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet 
structure. These results highlight the potential application of SAHS proteins as 
stabilizing molecules for preservation of cells.

Anhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by 
entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival 
strategies. This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known 
for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize 
several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive 
expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius 
varieornatus. These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha 
helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ 
significantly in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored 
the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and 
tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we 
examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in 
response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 
tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings 
not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis 
but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.Key words: 
anhydrobiosis, Tardigrades, live imaging, disordered proteins, desiccation

Water unavailability is an abiotic stress causing unfavourable conditions for 
life. Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for 
the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct 
response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical 
changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One 
stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the 
eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis was used to investigate the occurrence of 
ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of 
ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and 
represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree 
of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. 
spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA 
interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after 
desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised 
survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the 
gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase 
and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our 
study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. 
Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many 
different molecules working together.

We developed a new model of hypodynamic loading to support mice in chronic 
conditions of partial weight bearing, enabling simulations of reduced gravity 
environments and related clinical conditions. The novel hardware allows for 
reduced loading between 10 and 80% of normal body weight on all four limbs and 
enables characteristic quadrupedal locomotion. Ten-week-old female BALB/cByJ 
mice were supported for 21 days under Mars-analog suspension (38% weight 
bearing) and compared with age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) 
controls. After an initial adaptation, weight gain did not differ between 
groups, suggesting low levels of animal stress. Relative to age-matched 
controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had significantly lower muscle 
mass (-23% gastrocnemius wet mass, P < 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone 
morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: -24% at the distal femur, and cortical 
thickness: -11% at the femoral midshaft, both P < 0.001); and biomechanical 
properties of the femoral midshaft (i.e., -27% ultimate moment, P < 0.001). Bone 
formation indexes were decreased compared with age-matched full-weight-bearing 
mice, whereas resorption parameters were largely unchanged. Singly housed, 
full-weight-bearing controls with forelimb jackets were largely similar to 
age-matched, group-housed controls, although a few variables differed and 
warrant further investigation. Altogether, these data provide strong rationale 
for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the 
musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments.

Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its 
mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and 
below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and 
muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight 
suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a 
tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. 
Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 
20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) 
group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal 
housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, 
and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and 
muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. 
Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, 
trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur 
midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load 
reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone 
deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better 
bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater 
mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that 
the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term 
loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone 
of the hindlimb.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential of electrical impedance myography (EIM) to 
serve as a marker of muscle fiber atrophy and secondarily as an indicator of 
bone deterioration by assessing the effects of spaceflight or hind limb 
unloading.
METHODS: In the first experiment, 6 mice were flown aboard the space shuttle 
(STS-135) for 13 days and 8 earthbound mice served as controls. In the second 
experiment, 14 mice underwent hind limb unloading (HLU) for 13 days; 13 
additional mice served as controls. EIM measurements were made on ex vivo 
gastrocnemius muscle. Quantitative microscopy and areal bone mineral density 
(aBMD) measurements of the hindlimb were also performed.
RESULTS: Reductions in the multifrequency phase-slope parameter were observed 
for both the space flight and HLU cohorts compared to their respective controls. 
For ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 24.7±1.3°/MHz and 
14.1±1.6°/MHz, respectively (p=0.0013); for control and HLU groups, the values 
were 23.9±1.6°/MHz and 19.0±1.0°/MHz, respectively (p=0.014). This parameter 
also correlated with muscle fiber size (ρ=0.65, p=0.011) for spaceflight and 
hind limb aBMD (ρ=0.65, p=0.0063) for both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support the concept that EIM may serve as a useful tool 
for assessment of muscle disuse secondary to immobilization or microgravity.

Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, 
many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the 
Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given 
that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to 
earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors 
(e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of 
return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two 
different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard 
the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed 
on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days 
vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid 
accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of 
strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by 
RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains 
related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty 
acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In 
addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across 
all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, 
quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins 
were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data 
indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors 
alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during 
spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, 
a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver 
disease and should be investigated further.

Previous work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A-fusion protein 
(mBMPR1A-mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream 
signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A-mFc 
leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, 
via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested 
the effects of mBMPR1A-mFc on disuse-induced bone loss caused by 21 days of 
hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult 
female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n = 10 
each): CON-VEH; CON-mBMPR1A-mFc; HLU-VEH; and HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc. Mice were 
injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A-mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2×/week). Leg BMD 
declined in the HLU-VEH group (-5.3% ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in 
HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc (-0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU-VEH). Leg BMD increased 
significantly more in CON-mBMPR1A-mFc than CON-VEH (10.2% ± 0.6% versus 
4.4% ± 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was 
worse in the HLU-VEH compared to CON-VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A-mFc treatment for 
3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and 
CON groups compared to comparable VEH-treated counterparts (p < 0.05). 
HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load (p < 0.05) compared to 
their VEH-treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that 
treatment with mBMPR1A-mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and 
mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5-fold and fivefold higher bone 
formation rate in the mBMPR1A-mFc-treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, 
respectively. mBMPR1A-mFc-treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but 
significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH-treated animals in both the CON 
and HLU groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the 
soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal 
integrity in the setting of disuse-induced bone loss.

Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed 
rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling 
of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding 
(NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose 
mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female 
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). 
Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and 
NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes 
associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, 
the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU 
imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone's response to altered 
mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess 
the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously 
unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to 
prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.

Introduction: It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction 
following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or 
from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex 
space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved 
whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space 
exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a 
single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR5-ion) develop cardiovascular 
dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological 
basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass 
spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and 
phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months 
post-radiation. Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated 
versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted p-value of 
≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, 
there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the 
heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated 
peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, 
there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 
technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, 
and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. 
For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated 
and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways 
significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the 
phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted 
p-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed 
in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil 
extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR5-ion 
irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in 
combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting 
damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis. Discussion: These 
findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR5-ion results in long-lasting 
changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute 
and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously 
described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.

The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and 
reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant 
during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of 
that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 
30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied 
geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in 
statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors 
to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's 
vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during 
the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to 
dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred 
at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail 
responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was 
restored.

The utricle provides the vestibular reflex pathways with the sensory codes of 
inertial acceleration of self-motion and head orientation with respect to 
gravity to control balance and equilibrium. Here we present an anatomical 
description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish and establish a 
morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, 
scanning, and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to 
visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural 
innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used 
to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. 
Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and 
light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) 
reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology 
with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were 
compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a 
segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic 
contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral 
extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent 
lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular 
location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle 
polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically 
directed towards a limited number of 7-13 hair cells, but larger dendritic 
fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; 
and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or 
can synapse upon several afferents.

Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory 
systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among 
vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head 
translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in 
gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an 
organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular 
afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, in 
normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1-32-day exposures to 2.24 g 
(resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures 
to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1-8 days recovery to HG exposures to study 
re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent 
vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular 
velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation 
were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 
228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called 
On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. 
Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function 
of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3-4 days 
followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed 
after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed 
after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and 
medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin 
sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed 
to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent 
physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in 
their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent 
pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. 
Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of 
utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g 
resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.

Coat protein complex I (COPI) and COPII are required for bidirectional membrane 
trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. While these 
core coat machineries and other transport factors are highly conserved across 
species, high-resolution imaging studies indicate that the organization of the 
ER-Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of COPII assembly, 
in some cases to manage distinct cellular cargo, is emerging as one important 
component in determining this structure. Comparison of the ER-Golgi interface 
across different systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, reveals 
fundamental elements and distinct organization of this interface. A better 
understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet varying cellular 
secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control 
efficient trafficking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway.

Cells operate a signaling network termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) to 
monitor protein-folding capacity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 
Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) is an ER transmembrane sensor that activates 
the UPR to maintain the ER and cellular function. Although mammalian IRE1 
promotes cell survival, it can initiate apoptosis via decay of antiapoptotic 
miRNAs. Convergent and divergent IRE1 characteristics between plants and animals 
underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis. This review provides an 
updated scenario of the IRE1 signaling model, discusses emerging IRE1 sensing 
mechanisms, compares IRE1 features among species, and outlines exciting future 
directions in UPR research.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling network triggered by overload 
of protein-folding demand in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition termed 
ER stress. The UPR is critical for growth and development; nonetheless, 
connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain 
largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone 
auxin, a master regulator of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers 
down-regulation of auxin receptors and transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana. We 
also demonstrate that an Arabidopsis mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor IRE1 
exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support 
that the plant IRE1 is required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a 
species-specific feature of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, by 
establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin 
transporters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance 
of ER-based auxin regulation. We further examine the functional relationship of 
IRE1 and PIN5 by showing that an ire1 pin5 triple mutant enhances defects of UPR 
activation and auxin homeostasis in ire1 or pin5. Our results imply that the 
plant UPR has evolved a hormone-dependent strategy for coordinating ER function 
with physiological processes.

Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and 
function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these 
plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side 
chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, 
little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan 
function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants devoid 
of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that 
lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its 
wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it 
leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, 
and short inflorescence stems. Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, 
including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead 
accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by 
generating mur3 mutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, 
cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional 
xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural 
features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was 
modified in situ by generating mur3 mutants that lack specific xyloglucan 
xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress the XYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN 
GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2 (XLT2) gene. Normal growth was restored in the mur3-3 
mutant overexpressing XLT2 and in mur3-3 xxt double mutants when the 
dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated 
side chains. Our study assigns a role for galactosylation in normal xyloglucan 
function and demonstrates that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs 
diverse cellular and physiological processes.

To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors 
actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a 
cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared 
to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless 
fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight 
conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open 
questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the 
understanding plant ER stress management.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the gateway to the secretory pathway in all 
eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass through the Golgi apparatus on 
the way to the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the 
cell (vacuolar protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is 
present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and transport 
between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate 
compartment which is transported on microtubules. By contrast, higher plant 
cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the 
intermediate compartment is absent. Although many of the major molecular players 
involved in ER-Golgi trafficking in mammalian and yeast (Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae) cells have homologs in higher plants, the narrow interface (less 
than 500 nm) between the Golgi and the ER, together with the motility factor, 
makes the identification of the transport vectors responsible for bidirectional 
traffic between these two organelles much more difficult. Over the years, a 
controversy has arisen over the two major possibilities by which transfer can 
occur: through vesicles or direct tubular connections. In this article, four 
leading plant cell biologists attempted to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, 
their opinions are so divergent and often opposing that it was not possible to 
reach a consensus. Thus, we decided to let each tell his or her version 
individually. The review begins with an article by Federica Brandizzi that 
provides the necessary molecular background on coat protein complexes in 
relation to the so-called secretory units model for ER-Golgi transport in highly 
vacuolated plant cells. The second article, written by Chris Hawes, presents the 
evidence in favor of tubules. It is followed by an article from David Robinson 
defending the classical notion that transport occurs via vesicles. The last 
article, by Akihiko Nakano, introduces the reader to possible alternatives to 
vesicles or tubules, which are now emerging as a result of exciting new 
developments in high-resolution light microscopy in yeast.

Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. 
The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion 
and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship 
between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the 
underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects 
of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants 
with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate 
cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were 
varied through manipulation of cotton Golgi-related (CGR) 2 or 3 genes encoding 
two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases. Increased levels of 
methylesterification in a line over-expressing CGR2 (CGR2OX) resulted in highly 
expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced 
methylesterification in a mutant lacking both CGR-genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) 
resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO2 diffusion to 
chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but 
decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the CGR-mutants 
can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based 
photosynthesis. Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in 
carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; 
however, CGR-mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in 
this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the 
cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic 
carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area.

Eukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of cellular 
volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms are poorly understood. 
From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana, 
we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function 
that is homologous to two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to 
FRIENDLY, which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of 
mitochondria in Arabidopsis. In contrast to FRIENDLY, these three homologs of 
FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we 
proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a small gene family to help regulate the 
energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts. 
Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast 
phenotypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted 
to chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these genes as REDUCED 
CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC). The size of the chloroplast compartment was reduced 
most in rec1 mutants. The REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the 
nucleus. REC1 was excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with 
amitrole, which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude 
that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size of the 
chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell expansion or 
chloroplasts may regulate REC1.

Much like a factory, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) assembles simple cellular 
building blocks into complex molecular machines known as proteins. In order to 
protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular 
delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have 
evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response 
(UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the ER. This process is particularly 
important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for 
survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the 
UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors 
of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect 
organism growth and development as well as stress responses. In this review we 
outline recent developments in this field that support a strong relevance of the 
UPR to many areas of plant life.

In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the 
accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, 
negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR 
and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS 
linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on 
the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in 
Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, 
contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that 
during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive 
UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results 
ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from 
proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific 
feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes.

Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be 
indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and 
human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants 
respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded 
protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number 
of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 
To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild 
type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the 
International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially 
alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared with ground 
control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants 
on the ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceflight 
condition. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to 
growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the 
activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators 
in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.

Maintaining astronaut health throughout long-duration spaceflight is essential 
to the feasibility of a manned mission to Mars. The ground-based Mars500 
experiment investigated long-duration health by isolating six astronauts for 
520 days, the longest controlled human confinement study conducted to date. 
After 520 days, astronauts had uniform strength and lean body mass losses, and 
increased fasting plasma glucose, calprotectin, and neutrophil levels 
characteristic of intestinal inflammation but previous analyses revealed no 
common significant changes in gut microbiota. This study reanalysed data from 
early (days 7-45) and late (days 420-520) faecal samples and identified 408 
exact sequence variants (ESVs), including 213 shared by all astronauts. 
Thirty-two ESVs were significantly differentially abundant over time, including 
depletion of keystone resistant starch degrading, anti-inflammatory and insulin 
sensitivity-associated species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, 
Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, Roseburia faecis, and 
Lactobacillus rogosae, and enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria. 
Additionally, the extraordinary experimental confinement allowed observation of 
microbiota potentially shared between astronauts and their habitat. Forty-nine 
species were shared, representing 49% and 12% of the human and environmental 
microbiome diversity, respectively. These findings reveal the microbiota which 
significantly altered in relative abundance throughout confinement, including 
species known to influence inflammation and host glucose homeostasis consistent 
with astronaut symptoms. Identification of microbiome alterations after 520 days 
of isolation represents a missing piece connecting Mars500 astronaut 
physiological studies. Knowledge of the impact of long-term confinement upon the 
human microbiome helps to improve our understanding of how humans interact with 
their habitats and is a valuable step forward towards enabling long-duration 
spaceflight.

Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic 
weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and 
animals. DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than 
that generated by gamma rays. To understand the genetic requirements for 
resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana 
mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison 
of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to 
conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of 
radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. Similarly, in wild-type lines, 
loss of somatic heterozygosity was induced at an RBE of about a 2:1 (HZE versus 
gamma). Checkpoint and repair defects, as expected, enhanced sensitivity to both 
agents. The ""replication fork"" checkpoint, governed by ATR, played a slightly 
more important role in resistance to HZE-induced mutagenesis than in resistance 
to gamma induced mutagenesis.

Parabolic flights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to ""weightless"" or 
reduced gravity conditions, facilitating research and validation activities that 
complement infrequent and costly access to space. Although parabolic flights 
have been conducted for decades, reference acceleration profiles and processing 
methods are not widely available. Here we present a solution for collecting, 
analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during 
parabolic flights, which we validated during a Boeing 727-200F flight with 20 
parabolas. All data and analysis code are freely available. Our solution can be 
integrated with diverse experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer 
orientation, and allows unsupervised classification of all phases of flight, 
providing a consistent and open-source approach to quantifying gravito-inertial 
accelerations (GIA), or g levels. As academic, governmental, and commercial use 
of space advances, data availability and validated processing methods will 
enable better planning, execution, and analysis of parabolic flight experiments, 
and thus facilitate future space activities.

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression levels 
of multiple cytoskeletal proteins in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice that 
were euthanized onboard the United States Orbital Segment of the International 
Space Station 37 days after the start of the SpaceX-4 mission (September 2014, 
USA). The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the 
cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were significant changes in the 
mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase 
in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the 
cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase 
did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was 
significantly decreased.

We examined the effects of ∼30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 
(GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone 
samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and 
RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3β content across all missions, whereas its serine 
phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3β was 
linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as 
these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of 
inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that 
muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, 
and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In 
bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, 
muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to 
hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 
inhibition during spaceflight.

Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant 
skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly 
attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 
(SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage 
site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently 
demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of 
the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in 
reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. 
The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with 
the antioxidant, Manganese(III) 
meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), 
could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles 
from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the 
international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. 
Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly 
increased SERCA's ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content 
(marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In 
conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy 
and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work 
should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at 
increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak.

The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to 
space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize 
and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal 
and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the 
International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the 
expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, 
cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We 
additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and 
migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to 
target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal 
and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were 
downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, 
LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling 
molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased 
mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal 
derivative markers (TNNT2, VWF, and RUNX2), reduced readiness to form 
endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were 
observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased 
expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by 
enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and 
migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased 
expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative 
potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by 
regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac 
repair.

Over the past 20+ years, the U.S. Government has made significant strides in 
establishing research funding and initiating a portfolio consisting of subject 
matter experts on radiation-induced biological effects in normal tissues. 
Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the 
early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, 
due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing 
damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding 
the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce 
adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI 
research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), 
first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has 
provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and 
translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one 
day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear 
incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the 
possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic 
lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has 
identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators 
to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with 
sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and 
findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker 
identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet 
undeniably similar human populations - cancer patients, public citizens, and 
astronauts.

Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and 
a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been 
recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station 
(ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their 
potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both 
clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and 
unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid 
content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival 
when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks 
of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS 
strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the 
culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated 
known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently 
available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information 
alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic 
characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.

We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant 
macrophage colony stimulating (rM-CSF) factor for 14 days during the flight of 
space shuttle Space Transportation System (STS)-126. We tested the hypothesis 
that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow 
cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to 
define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; 
including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In 
addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene 
microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of 
macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We 
found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that 
expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no 
changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded 
differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript 
levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome 
but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed 
after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space 
flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a 
space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from 
mouse bone marrow cells.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human 
monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). To determine what host components are important 
for bacterial replication, we performed microarray analysis on Drosophila 
melanogaster S2 cells by comparing host gene transcript levels between 
permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E. chaffeensis growth. Five-hundred 
twenty-seven genes had increased transcript levels unique to permissive growth 
conditions 24 h postinfection. We screened adult flies that were mutants for 
several of the ""permissive"" genes for the ability to support Ehrlichia 
replication. Three additional D. melanogaster fly lines with putative mutations 
in pyrimidine metabolism were also tested. Ten fly lines carrying mutations in 
the genes CG6479, separation anxiety, chitinase 11, CG6364 (Uck2), CG6543 
(Echs1), withered (whd), CG15881 (Ccdc58), CG14806 (Apop1), CG11875 (Nup37), and 
dumpy (dp) had increased resistance to infection with Ehrlichia. Analysis of RNA 
by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that the 
bacterial load was decreased in these mutant flies compared to wild-type 
infected control flies. Seven of these genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, 
Ccdc58, and Apop1) encoded proteins that had mitochondrial functions or could be 
associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. Treatment of THP-1 cells 
with double-stranded RNA to silence the human UCK2 gene indicates that the 
disruption of the uridine-cytidine kinase affects E. chaffeensis replication in 
human macrophages. Experiments with cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), a CTP 
synthetase inhibitor and cytosine, suggest that the nucleotide salvage pathway 
is essential for E. chaffeensis replication and that it may be important for the 
provision of CTP, uridine, and cytidine nucleotides.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which 
causes the tick-borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In vertebrates, E. 
chaffeensis replicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or 
tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host 
genes that control E. chaffeensis replication and infection in vivo in 
Drosophila, Uridine cytidine kinase and separation anxiety. Using the UAS-GAL4 
RNAi system, we generated F1 flies (UAS-gene of interestRNAi x tissue-GAL4 
flies) that have Uck2 or san silenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. 
When Uck2 or san were suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body, E. 
chaffeensis replicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections. 
Silencing of these genes in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands did not 
impact fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. Our data suggest that in 
Drosophila, E. chaffeensis replicates within the hemocytes, the insect homolog 
of mammalian macrophages, and in the fat body, the liver homolog of mammals.

BACKGROUND: African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a major threat to pig production 
and the lack of effective vaccines underscores the need to develop robust 
antiviral countermeasures. Pathologically, a significant elevation in 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production is associated with ASFV infection in pigs 
and there is high interest in identifying dual-acting natural compounds that 
exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities.
METHODS: Using the laboratory-adapted ASFV BA71V strain, we screened a library 
of 297 natural, anti-inflammatory compounds to identify promising candidates 
that protected Vero cells against virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Virus 
yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on 
positive hits and two lead compounds were further characterized in 
dose-dependent assays along with time-of-addition, time-of-removal, virus entry, 
and viral protein synthesis assays. The antiviral effects of the two lead 
compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) 
were also tested using similar methods, and the ability to inhibit 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production during virulent ASFV infection was assessed 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: The screen identified five compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by 
greater than 50% and virus yield reduction experiments showed that two of these 
compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of 
anti-ASFV activity. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that both compounds potently 
inhibited early stages of ASFV infection and that the compounds also inhibited 
infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Importantly, during ASFV 
infection in PAM cells, both compounds markedly reduced the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis while tetrandrine 
had a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds 
with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and 
therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral 
replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.

Understanding macrophage differentiation during space flight: The importance of 
ground-based experiments before space flight.

Chapes SK, Ortega MT.

In preparation for a space flight on STS-126, two in vitro culture systems were 
used to investigate macrophage colony stimulating factor-dependent macrophage 
differentiation from mouse primary bone marrow cells. The patented Techshot Cell 
Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA) were operated 
in different orientations to determine their impact on macrophage growth and 
differentiation. Bone marrow cell parameters were determined after cells were 
grown in FPAs incubated at 37°C in vertical or horizontal orientations, and 
macrophage cell recovery was significantly higher from FPAs that were incubated 
in the horizontal orientation compared to ""vertical"" FPAs. Similarly, when bone 
marrow cells were grown in the Techshot bioreactor, there were significant 
differences in the numbers of macrophages recovered after 7 days, depending on 
movement and orientation of the bioreactor. Macrophage recovery was highest when 
the patented bioreactor was rotated in the horizontal, x-axis plane 
(merry-go-round fashion) compared to static and vertically, y-axis plane rotated 
(Ferris wheel fashion) bioreactors. In addition, the expression of F4/80 and 
other differentiation markers varied depending on whether macrophages 
differentiated in FPAs or in bioreactors. After 7 days, significant differences 
in size, granularity and molecule expression were seen even when the same 
primary bone marrow cells were used to seed the cultures. These data show that 
culture outcomes are highly dependent on the culture device and device 
orientation. Moreover, the impact of the culture system needs to be understood 
in order to interpret space flight data.

Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory 
macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and 
metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to 
be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is 
involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we 
investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated 
inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with 
either leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and 
challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with 
db/db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity 
compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice 
displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa, Il6, and 
Ccl2. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer 
crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages 
expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C 
chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory 
phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared 
with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone 
marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many 
of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish 
a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic 
inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory 
cytokine.

Metabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction 
pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune 
responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the 
body's major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune 
system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between 
leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin 
receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using 
bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were 
differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse 
macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. 
The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were 
cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The 
macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4-5 days before 
reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have 
phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin 
receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with 
interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, 
DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte 
conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe 
that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the 
leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system 
dysregulation.

Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. In particular, splenic B 
cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological 
models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after 
space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on 
antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing 
and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can 
now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and 
modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations 
on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage 
methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from 
multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that 
sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire 
characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a 
bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ 
variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on 
Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets and is specifically designed to reduce bias, 
capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that 
provides other data mining options. We validated our workflow by comparing our 
normal mouse MiSeq data to existing murine antibody repertoire studies 
validating it for future antibody repertoire studies.

Antibody specificity and diversity are generated through the enzymatic splicing 
of genomic gene segments within each B cell. Antibodies are heterodimers of 
heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody 
repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J 
mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody 
transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain 
immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was 
uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene 
segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. 
Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of 
individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly 
varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been 
previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that 
were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presents a unique, 
non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody 
repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.

Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering 
the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express 
highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), 
that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through 
the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in 
a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has 
been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings 
using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the 
hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this 
hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig 
repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space 
Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to 
ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground 
control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions 
in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between 
treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH 
and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did 
not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a 
short period of time.

Sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. 
Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively 
multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a 
data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified 
sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those 
processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA 
vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and 
submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts 
but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read 
count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads 
than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the 
unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the 
unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have 
shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects 
more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.

This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based human 
factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon-optimized and 
CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific

of 1.0 × 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was 
shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a 
hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and

Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of 
TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 1012 and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male 
C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse 
clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the 
liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site 
analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal 
outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in 
hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These 
preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754.

Ab repertoire diversity plays a critical role in the host's ability to fight 
pathogens. CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab-Ag binding and is a significant 
source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ 
rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and 
splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire 
diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on 
the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were 
analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of 
diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of 
spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of 
microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow 
repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected 
differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not 
detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to 
find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and 
tissues.

Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes 
of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, 
cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceflight 
on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of 
all spaceflight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice (n = 10) were 
exposed to and sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight in microgravity. 
Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) 
groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and 
similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were 
collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. 
Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was fixed for 
estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of 
the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not 
appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat 
control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid 
concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while 
progesterone levels were lower (p < 0.05) in habitat and flight compared to 
baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not 
differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically 
impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall 
estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, 
since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different 
estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian 
cyclicity and may yet be fertile.

BACKGROUND: Abundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the 
International Space Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria 
cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome 
characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and 
virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured 
during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria 
grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet 
able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity 
environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects 
bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine 
whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental 
conditions, or organism specific responses.
RESULTS: Here, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, 
oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 
modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed that P. 
aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density 
relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the 
media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the 
availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final 
cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because 
motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we 
compared the growth of wild-type P. aeruginosa to a ΔmotABCD mutant deficient in 
swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility 
mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions 
tested.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell 
densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an 
interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates 
essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under 
nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under 
microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority 
of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under 
nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact 
microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial 
growth and physiology.

Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for 
the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial 
communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and 
continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and 
safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern 
due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While 
planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to 
increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm 
development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and 
STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. 
Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm 
biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the 
biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that 
has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the 
formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be 
independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, 
flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this 
biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first 
evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and 
highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial 
human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.

With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify 
precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms 
exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis 
working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing 
short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The 
pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene 
quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed 
genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data 
submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab 
database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of 
this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability 
of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future 
spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from 
other databases with the data available in GeneLab.

The mission of NASA's GeneLab database (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) is to 
collect, curate, and provide access to the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic 
and metabolomic (so-called 'omics') data from biospecimens flown in space or 
exposed to simulated space stressors, maximizing their utilization. This large 
collection of data enables the exploration of molecular network responses to 
space environments using a systems biology approach. We review here the various 
components of the GeneLab platform, including the new data repository web 
interface, and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) web portal, which will 
support the expansion of the database in the future to include companion 
non-omics assay data. We discuss our design for GEODE, particularly how it 
promotes investigators providing more accurate metadata, reducing the curation 
effort required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab 
Application Programming Interface (API) specifically designed to support tools 
for the visualization of processed omics data. We review the outreach efforts by 
GeneLab to utilize the spaceflight data in the repository to generate novel 
discoveries and develop new hypotheses, including spearheading data analysis 
working groups, and a high school student training program. All these efforts 
are aimed ultimately at supporting precision risk management for human space 
exploration.

Spaceflight is known to impose changes on human physiology with unknown 
molecular etiologies. To reveal these causes, we used a multi-omics, systems 
biology analytical approach using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts 
and data from NASA's GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space to 
determine transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic responses to 
spaceflight. Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omics datasets showed 
significant enrichment for mitochondrial processes, as well as innate immunity, 
chronic inflammation, cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions. 
Importantly, NASA's Twin Study provided a platform to confirm several of our 
principal findings. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage 
was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut 
cohort and NASA Twin Study data, indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent 
phenotype of spaceflight.

Space agencies have announced plans for human missions to the Moon to prepare 
for Mars. However, the space environment presents stressors that include 
radiation, microgravity, and isolation. Understanding how these factors affect 
biology is crucial for safe and effective crewed space exploration. There is a 
need to develop countermeasures, to adapt plants and microbes for nutrient 
sources and bioregenerative life support, and to limit pathogen infection. 
Scientists across the world are conducting space omics experiments on model 
organisms and, more recently, on humans. Optimal extraction of actionable 
scientific discoveries from these precious datasets will only occur at the 
collective level with improved standardization. To address this shortcoming, we 
established ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an 
international consortium of scientists who aim to enhance standard guidelines 
between space biologists at a global level. Here we introduce our consortium and 
share past lessons learned and future challenges related to spaceflight omics.

There has long been an interest in understanding how the hazards from 
spaceflight may trigger or exacerbate human diseases. With the goal of advancing 
our knowledge on physiological changes during space travel, NASA GeneLab 
provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated 
spaceflight studies. Alone, this data enables identification of biological 
changes during spaceflight, but cannot infer how that may impact an astronaut at 
the phenotypic level. To bridge this gap, Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented 
Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a heterogeneous knowledge graph connecting biological 
and clinical data from over 30 databases, was used in combination with GeneLab 
transcriptomic data from six studies. This integration identified critical 
symptoms and physiological changes incurred during spaceflight.

With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify 
precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms 
exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis 
working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing 
short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The 
pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene 
quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed 
genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data 
submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab 
database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of 
this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability 
of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future 
spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from 
other databases with the data available in GeneLab.

Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a significant health risk 
for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed 
an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics 
and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the 
impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative 
analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed 
significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, 
synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, 
hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed 
astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some 
spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with 
neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. 
Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards 
understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual 
brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future 
spaceflight studies. For broader scientific impact, all datasets from this study 
are available through an interactive data portal, as well as the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).

The increasing accessibility of commercial and private space travel necessitates 
a profound understanding of its impact on human health. The NASA Open Science 
Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological 
studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive 
data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical 
assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological 
responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging 
the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven 
data standards established by NASA's OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower 
artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, 
guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article 
presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including 
programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a 
precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, 
propelling research in the burgeoning field of commercial space travel's impact 
on human physiology.

One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to 
fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. 
It is evident that the spaceflight environment causes multiple alterations to 
musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a 
few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare 
gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of 
the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these 
archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly 
reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining 
shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate 
mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or 
other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight 
certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as 
differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a 
variety of altered gravity conditions. However, the level of overlap between 
species was found to be significantly limited, partly attributed to the limited 
availability of human samples.

AIM: Fluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through 
lymphatic vessels is necessary for tissue homeostasis. While lymphatic capillary 
structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominant 
route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport 
has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae 
also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide 
regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact ""lymphatic function""?
METHODS: Various aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice 
constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (""CavKO""), the protein required for caveolae 
formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific Cav1 gene 
deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1flox/flox ; ""LyCav"") and ex vivo in their vessels and 
cells.
RESULTS: In each model, lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged. The 
lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in 
both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the 
permeability to 70 kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs 
isolated from CavKO mice. Conversely, transport within the lymphatic system to 
the sentinel node was significantly reduced in anaesthetized CavKO and LyCav 
mice. Isolated, cannulated collecting vessel studies identified significantly 
reduced phasic contractility when lymphatic endothelium lacks caveolae. 
Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase was able to partially restore ex vivo vessel 
contractility.
CONCLUSION: Macromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of 
caveolae, yet phasic contractility reduced, resulting in reduced overall 
lymphatic transport function. These studies identify lymphatic caveolar biology 
as a key regulator of active lymphatic transport functions.

Human occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, 
there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the 
International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA's Artemis 
missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more 
human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth's orbit and beyond. On 
Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow 
when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know 
how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their 
unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal 
communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the 
ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 
bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). 
When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative 
humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community 
composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R2 = 0.35, 
P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote 
healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and 
planetary protection.

BACKGROUND: The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more 
people living and working in unique built environments similar to the 
International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that 
contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in 
these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from 
a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health 
outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for 
modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated 
relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community 
composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust 
from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with 
activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative 
humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 
4.4 × 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no 
exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 1010 when exposed to 100% relative 
humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal 
diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta 
(R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled 
using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change 
based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, 
P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 
85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to 
develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard 
human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include 
other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon 
dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in 
spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft 
integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in 
low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond. Video Abstract.

Bone loss with aging and menopause may be linked to vascular endothelial 
dysfunction. The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative 
modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient 
artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume 
(BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female 
Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old 
intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen 
replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation 
was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal 
femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was 
diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82±7; OVX, 
61±9; OVX+E2, 90±4%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV 
(intact, 28.7±1.6; OVX, 16.3±0.9; OVX+E2, 25.7±1.4%). In old animals, 
vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement 
(intact, 55±8; OVX, 59±7; OVX+E2, 92±4%). Likewise, modifications in BV/TV 
followed the same pattern (intact, 33.1±1.6; OVX, 34.4±3.7; OVX+E2, 42.4±2.1%). 
Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old 
OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R(2) = 0.630; P<0.001). These data 
demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and 
BV/TV, and provide for a possible coupling mechanism linking 
endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling.

Chronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. The purpose of 
the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14days of skeletal 
unloading alter femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance 
during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are 
associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery 
(PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d 
or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion 
was measured following 10min of standing (reloading) following the unloading 
treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and 
maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural 
characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential 
wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal 
metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, 
diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control 
rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU 
rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs 
from 14-d HU rats (138±5μm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162±6μm), and 
medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3±0.6μm) versus that 
of control (18.0±0.8μm) rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential 
stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with 
the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The 
results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to 
increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate 
acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance 
vasculature.

Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body 
mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. 
During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance 
within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular 
system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the 
decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the 
hypotheses that 1) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise 
with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of 
adipose-resistance arteries, and 2) chronic exercise training would mitigate the 
age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; 
n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young 
sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old 
exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill 
exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro 
α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from 
AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a 
directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (≈ 150% 
increase) and YSed (≈ 55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and 
myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance 
arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between 
age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml · min(-1) · 100(-1) g; OET, 8.1 ± 
0.9 ml · min(-1) · 100(-1) g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and 
α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group 
relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase 
vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a 
diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate 
that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate 
age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.

Following exposure to microgravity, there is a reduced ability of astronauts to 
augment peripheral vascular resistance, often resulting in orthostatic 
hypotension. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
mesenteric arteries and veins will exhibit diminished vasoconstrictor responses 
after spaceflight. Mesenteric arteries and veins from female mice flown on the 
Space Transportation System (STS)-131 (n=11), STS-133 (n=6), and STS-135 (n=3) 
shuttle missions and respective ground-based control mice (n=30) were isolated 
for in vitro experimentation. Vasoconstrictor responses were evoked in arteries 
via norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine, and in veins 
through NE across a range of intraluminal pressures (2-12 cmH(2)O). 
Vasoconstriction to NE was also determined in mesenteric arteries at 1, 5, and 7 
d postlanding. In arteries, maximal constriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine were 
reduced immediately following spaceflight and 1 d postflight. Spaceflight also 
reduced arterial ryanodine receptor-3 mRNA levels. In mesenteric veins, there 
was diminished constriction to NE after flight. The results indicate that the 
impaired vasoconstriction following spaceflight occurs through the ryanodine 
receptor-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) release mechanism. Such vascular changes 
in astronauts could compromise the maintenance of arterial pressure during 
orthostatic stress.

Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in 
astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating 
the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are 
associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral 
arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the 
hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 
shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall 
thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral 
arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 
9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. 
Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and 
vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice 
(n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery 
maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236±9 μm and GC: 215±5 μm) with no 
difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4±1.6 μm; GC: 12.2±1.2 μm). 
Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice 
(SF: 3.4±0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4±0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions 
in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of 
cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during 
spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could 
contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of 
visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.

INTRODUCTION: The principal nutrient artery to the femur demonstrates an 
increase in nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in rats after treadmill exercise 
training. The present study sought to determine whether exercise training 
improves hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow distribution at rest and during 
exercise.
METHODS: Six 8-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exercise trained (ET) 
with treadmill walking at 15 m · min(-1) up a 15° incline for 60 min · d(-1) 
over a 10- to 12-wk period. Sedentary (SED) control animals were acclimated to 
treadmill exercise for 5 min · d(-1) during the week preceding the blood flow 
measurements. Blood flow to nine distinct regions of the femur, tibia, and 
fibula was determined at rest and during low-intensity exercise (15 m · min(-1) 
walking, 0° incline) using the reference sample microsphere method.
RESULTS: The results demonstrate an augmentation of exercise hyperemia above 
that observed in SED rats during exercise in only one region of the bone, the 
femoral diaphysis, of ET rats. However, whereas exercise hyperemia occurred in 
three of the nine hindlimb bone regions measured in SED rats, exercise hyperemia 
occurred in seven of nine regions in ET rats.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate an increase in generalized hindlimb bone and 
marrow blood flow during physical activity after a period of exercise training. 
Elevations in regional bone and marrow blood flow after training may augment 
medullary pressure and bone interstitial fluid flow, thus benefiting bone 
integrity.

Spaceflight and prolonged bed rest induce deconditioning of the cardiovascular 
system and bone loss. Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and 
marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in 
hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. We hypothesized 
that the attenuated bone and marrow perfusion may result from altered vasomotor 
properties of the bone resistance vasculature. Therefore, the purpose of this 
study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and 
vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main 
conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats. 
Vasoconstriction of the femoral PNA was assessed in vitro using norepinephrine, 
phenylephrine, clonidine, KCl, endothelin-1, arginine vasopressin, and myogenic 
responsiveness. Vasodilation through endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine, 
bradykinin, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] and endothelium-independent 
mechanisms [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and adenosine] were also determined. 
Vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the PNA from HU rats was not enhanced through 
any of the mechanisms tested. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to 
acetylcholine (CON, 86 ± 3%; HU, 48 ± 7% vasodilation) and FMD (CON, 61 ± 9%; 
HU, 11 ± 11% vasodilation) were attenuated in PNAs from HU rats, while responses 
to bradykinin were not different between groups. Endothelium-independent 
vasodilation to SNP and adenosine were not different between groups. These data 
indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and 
increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor 
responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with 
reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.

Bone health and cardiovascular function are compromised in individuals with type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of T2DM 
in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Responses of the principal nutrient artery 
(PNA) of the femur from obese ZDF rats with prediabetes, short-term diabetes, 
and long-term diabetes to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and -independent 
(sodium nitroprusside) vasodilation and potassium chloride, norepinephrine (NE), 
and a myogenic vasoconstrictor were determined in vitro. Few changes in the PNA 
vasomotor responses occurred for the prediabetic and short-term diabetic 
conditions. Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation were reduced, 
and NE and myogenic vasoconstriction were increased in obese ZDF rats with 
long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in 
endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and 
controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 
N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of 
the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with 
long-term T2DM. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, 
measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats 
with long-term diabetes. These findings indicate that the profound impairment of 
the bone circulation may contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long 
bones during chronic T2DM.

Conditions during spaceflight, such as the loss of the head-to-foot gravity 
vector, are thought to potentially alter cerebral blood flow and vascular 
resistance. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of 
long-term spaceflight on the functional, mechanical, and structural properties 
of cerebral arteries. Male C57BL/6N mice were flown 30 days in a Bion-M1 
biosatellite. Basilar arteries isolated from spaceflight (SF) (n = 6), habitat 
control (HC) (n = 6), and vivarium control (VC) (n = 16) mice were used for in 
vitro functional and mechanical testing and histological structural analysis. 
The results demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a voltage-gated 
Ca(2+) mechanism (30-80 mM KCl) and thromboxane A2 receptors (10(-8) - 3 × 
10(-5) M U46619) are lower in cerebral arteries from SF mice. Inhibition of 
Rho-kinase activity (1 μM Y27632) abolished group differences in U46619-evoked 
contractions. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (10 
μM, 2 μM U46619 preconstriction) was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from 
SF mice. The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice 
relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the 
extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/collagen 
ratio in the basilar arteries. Diameter, medial wall thickness, and medial 
cross-sectional area of unpressurized basilar arteries were not different among 
groups. These results suggest that the microgravity-induced attenuation of both 
vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties may limit the range of vascular 
control of cerebral perfusion or impair the distribution of brain blood flow 
during periods of stress.

As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and 
the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth's 
protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. 
The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due 
to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death 
differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) 
astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar 
astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. 
Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight 
(9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo 
lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO 
astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary 
purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and 
space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The 
results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular 
endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive 
artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts 
exposed to deep space radiation.

Coronary microvascular function and blood flow responses during acute exercise 
are impaired in the aged heart but can be restored by exercise training. 
Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth 
muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized 
that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular 
smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise 
training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic 
alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats 
underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end 
of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle 
proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated 
coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile 
function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth 
muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory 
phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. 
Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in 
arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the 
synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training 
improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and 
expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. 
Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of 
a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood 
flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth 
muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training. NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces 
a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile 
phenotype. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile dysfunction of 
coronary arterioles and restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth 
muscle.

Astronauts are reported to have experienced some impairment in visual acuity 
during their mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and after they 
returned to Earth. There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve 
alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible 
mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative 
stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after 
spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 12) were launched from the 
Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The 
animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace 
Exploration Agency (JAXA) ""Kibo"" facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived 
either under an ambient microgravity condition (µg) or in a centrifugal habitat 
unit that produced 1 g artificial gravity (µg + 1 g). Habitat control (HC) and 
vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, 
respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg 
group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells 
compared to all other groups (p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC 
group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell 
death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly 
altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more 
significant changes in regulated protein expression in the µg group relative to 
that in the µg + 1 g group. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces 
retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein 
expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic 
function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against 
these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect blood⁻retinal barrier 
(BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late 
retinal degeneration.

Introduction: Mechanical forces and sympathetic influences are key determinants 
of vascular structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that 
hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small 
arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and 
skin. Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal 
muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and 
saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and 
glyoxylic acid staining. Results: HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb 
arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery 
diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to 
noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the 
hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all 
region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased 
the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural 
artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density 
was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. 
Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically 
perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of 
the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls. Conclusion: 
HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and 
hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two 
hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to 
vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic 
influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial 
vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response 
in humans following space flight.

Astronauts exhibit an assortment of clinical abnormalities in their eyes during 
long-duration spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the retina or 
alters the epigenetic clock. The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure 
modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were 
maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and 
both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We 
found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with 
spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the 
transcriptome level. Several biological pathways involved in retinal diseases 
such as macular degeneration were significantly altered. Our results indicated 
that spaceflight decelerated the retinal epigenetic clock. This study 
demonstrates that spaceflight impacts the retina at the epigenomic and 
transcriptomic levels, and such changes could be involved in the etiology of 
eye-related disorders among astronauts.

This study examined the morphological development of the otolith vestibular 
receptors in quail. Here, we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, 
stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The 
otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic 
development reaching asymptotic values near posthatch day P7. Increases in hair 
cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed 
first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization 
was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half 
of all immature hair cells observed had nonpolarized internal kinocilia with the 
remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing 
techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar 
regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal 
growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton 
terminals at E8. Calyceal terminal formation began at E10; however, no mature 
calyces were observed until E12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. Calyx 
afferents innervating only Type I hair cells did not develop until E14. Finally, 
the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail 
utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to 
the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and 
Type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. 
Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many 
terminal boutons.

In all species studied, afferents from semicircular canals and otolith organs 
converge on central neurons in the brainstem. However, the spatial and temporal 
relationships between converging inputs and how these contribute to vestibular 
behaviors is not well understood. In the current study, we used discrete 
rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and 
otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons 
in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent 
responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but 
exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. 
Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the 
afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal 
signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple 
linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net 
responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation. We discuss these findings 
in the context of previous studies of pigeon vestibular behaviors, and we 
compare our findings to similar studies in other species.

Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly 
restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL)/receptor activator of nuclear 
factor kappa-Β (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease 
in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption 
followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development 
of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the 
signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed 
light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related 
diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca2+ signaling through the 
L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in 
long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether 
CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove 
expression of a gain-of-function CaV1.2 mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) using 
Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the 
auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice displayed 
osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological 
analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in 
mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found 
that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic 
capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased 
mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, 
suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS mutant channel 
contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we 
found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed 
defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the CaV1.2-dependent 
Ca2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and 
vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca2+ 
influx through CaV1.2TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby 
affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic 
capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms 
underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis.

The primary energy sources of mammalian cells are proteins, fats, and sugars 
that are processed by well-known biochemical mechanisms that have been 
discovered and studied in 1G (terrestrial gravity). Here we sought to determine 
how simulated microgravity (sim-µG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in 
oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. 
We report increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis 24 hr 
after exposure to sim-µG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after 3 days' 
exposure of OLs to sim-µG increased the Krebs cycle (Krebs and Weitzman, ) flux 
in sim-µG. The secretome study also revealed a significant increase in the 
synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids such as 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67); 
lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity. 
Although longer-chain lipids were not observed in this study, it is possible 
that at longer time points OLs would have continued moving forward toward the 
synthesis of lipids that constitute myelin. For centuries, basic developmental 
biology research has been the pillar of an array of discoveries that have led to 
clinical applications; we believe that studies using microgravity will open new 
avenues to our understanding of the brain in health and disease-in particular, 
to the discovery of new molecules and mechanisms impossible to unveil while in 
1G. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here we demonstrate that human neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate while in 
space and they express specific NSC markers after being in space. NSCs displayed 
both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells 
also kept their ability to become young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings 
of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties 
characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. Current 
injections elicited only an incipient action potential. No spontaneous synaptic 
events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most 
recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes. 
Ascertaining the origin of the NSCs' increased energy requirement is of the 
essence in order to design effective measures to minimize health risks 
associated with long-duration human spaceflight missions.

Considering the imminence of long-term space travel, it is necessary to 
investigate the impact of space microgravity (SPC-µG) in order to determine if 
this environment has consequences on the astronauts' health, in particular, 
neural and cognitive functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the 
regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning 
how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool 
for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological 
disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-µG resulted in 
enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of 
NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of 
abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where 
cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division 
(MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-µG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground 
control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health 
implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for 
understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term 
space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility. Knowledge of 
these mechanisms could help to develop preventive or corrective measures for 
successful long-term SPC-µG exposure.

Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure 
(VIIP) are some of the consequences of long-term space missions. Here we 
examined the behavior of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) after space flight 
using time-lapse microscopy. We show that most OLPs divided more than ground 
control (GC) counterparts did. Nonetheless, a subpopulation of OLPs flown to 
space presented a significant increase in autophagic cell death. Examination of 
the proteomic profile of the secretome of space flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) revealed 
that the stress protein heat shock protein-90 beta ""HSP-90β"" was the 5th most 
enriched (6.8 times) and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine 
""SPARC"" was the 7th most enriched (5.2 times), with respect to ground control 
cells. SPARC induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which leads to autophagy. 
Given the roles and importance of these two proteins in mammalian cells' 
metabolism, their upregulation may hold the key to modulating cell proliferation 
and autophagy, in order to mitigate ICP and VIIP during and after space 
missions.

Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure

determine how space microgravity (µG) impacts the metabolomics profile of 
oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells in the central 
nervous system. We report increased glutamate and energy metabolism while the 
OLPs were in space for 26 days. We also show that after space flight, OLPs (SPC 
OLPs) display significantly increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. 
These data are in agreement with our previous work using simulated microgravity. 
In addition, our global metabolomics approach allowed for the discovery of 
endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs while in space that are significantly 
modulated by microgravity. Our results provide, for the first time, relevant 
information about the energetic state of OLPs while in space and after space 
flight. The functional and molecular relevance of these specific pathways are 
promising targets for therapeutic intervention for humans in long-term space 
missions to the moon, Mars and beyond.

The change in gravitational force has a significant effect on biological tissues 
and the entire organism. As with any alteration in the environment, microgravity 
(µG) produces modifications in the system inducing adaptation to the new 
condition. In this study, we analyzed the effect of µG on neural stem cells 
(NSCs) following a space flight to the International Space Station (ISS). After 
3 days in space, analysis of the metabolome in culture medium revealed increased 
glycolysis with augmented pyruvate and glycerate levels, and activated 
catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glutamine. NSCs flown into 
space (SPC-NSCs) also showed increased synthesis of NADH and formation of 
polyamine spermidine when compared to ground controls (GC-NSCs). Overall, the 
space environment appears to increase energy demands in response to the µG 
setting.

Space exploration objectives will soon move from low Earth orbit to distant 
destinations like Moon and Mars. The present work provides an up-to-date roadmap 
that identifies critical research gaps related to human behavior and performance 
in altered gravity and space. The roadmap summarizes (1) key neurobehavioral 
challenges associated with spaceflight, (2) the need to consider sex as a 
biological variable, (3) the use of integrative omics technologies to elucidate 
mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and behavior, and (4) the importance 
of understanding the neural representation of gravity throughout the brain and 
its multisensory processing. We then highlight the need for a variety of 
target-specific countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as 
two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of 
spaceflight on the central nervous system and performance. We conclude with a 
summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs 
and stress the importance of new collaborative strategies across agencies and 
researchers for fostering an integrative cross- and transdisciplinary approach 
from cells, molecules to neural circuits and cognitive performance. Finally, we 
highlight that space research in neurocognitive science goes beyond monitoring 
and mitigating risks in astronauts but could also have significant benefits for 
the population on Earth.

Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the 
specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental 
issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes 
that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
thaliana) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 
12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater 
were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics 
procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which 
included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately 
quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that 
showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight 
samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated 
in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable 
proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. 
These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar 
spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship 
between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight 
responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence 
understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell 
wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets 
from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

Our primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in 
establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in primary roots. Major 
plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including 
the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then 
disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, 
experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity 
with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing 
fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green 
fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines 
of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1-GFP, pSCR::SCR-GFP to monitor 
auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live 
with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged 
on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined 
post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of 
any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically 
""vertical"" distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the 
establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity 
signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the 
root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting 
spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The 
distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not 
dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the 
development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence 
cytokinin-associated processes.

BACKGROUND: Skewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth 
strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing 
and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics guiding 
these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes 
skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. 
Col-0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain 
unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis 
ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to 
identify candidate genes involved in skewing.
RESULTS: This work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in 
skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. 
Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted 
growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the 
control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular 
processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, 
and hormone signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is 
associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and 
perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is 
needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root 
skewing.

In this article we report the identification of T-DNA (transfer DNA) insertion 
sites within two different gene regions in the genome of an Arabidopsis mutant 
line, SALK_084889. The T-DNA positions are in the 3' UTR (untranslated region) 
of DREB2A (Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A) (AT5G05410) and 
promoter of LOX1 (Lipoxygenase 1) (AT1G55020) as determined by DNA-PCR and 
sanger sequencing. The expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 were also analyzed 
using quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) in SALK_084889 and wild type Arabidopsis 
(Col, Columbia). Further, the comparison of drought and heat tolerance between 
Col and SALK_084889 were conducted by stress treatments. The present data 
indicate that in SALK_084889, the expression of DREB2A is not downregulated 
under normal growth conditions but can be affected only in roots under drought 
treatment, while LOX1 is significantly downregulated in both roots and shoots 
under all tested conditions. These data are original and have not been published 
elsewhere.

Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where 
repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the 
structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to 
plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight 
responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological 
adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes 
adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these 
spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, 
and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has 
yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to 
ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed 
without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased 
stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome 
responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as 
that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, 
phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response 
compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can 
actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of 
physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight 
transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating 
that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight 
adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential 
genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or 
perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were 
germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually 
mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space 
light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that 
manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost 
of spaceflight adaptation.

In this article we report the identification of a homozygous lethal T-DNA 
(transfer DNA) line within the coding region of the At1G05290 gene in the genome 
of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) line, SALK_063500. The T-DNA insertion is 
found within exon one of the AT1G05290 gene, however a homozygous T-DNA allele 
is unattainable. In the heterozygous T-DNA allele the expression levels of 
AT1G05290 were compared to wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0, Columbia). Further 
analyses revealed an aberrant silique phenotype found in the heterozygous 
SALK_063500 plants that is attributed to the reduced rate of pollen tube 
germination. These data are original and have not been published elsewhere.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: An imaging system was refined to monitor the health of 
vegetation grown in controlled conditions using spectral reflectance patterns. 
To measure plant health, the single-image normalized difference vegetation index 
(SI-NDVI) compares leaf reflectance in visible and near-infrared light 
spectrums.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The SI-NDVI imaging system was characterized to assess 
plant responses to stress before visual detection during controlled stress 
assays. Images were analyzed using Fiji image processing software and Microsoft 
Excel to create qualitative false color images and quantitative graphs to detect 
plant stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Stress was detected in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings within 15 min 
of salinity application using SI-NDVI analysis, before stress was visible. 
Stress was also observed during ammonium nitrate treatment of Eruca sativa 
plants before visual detection. Early detection of plant stress is possible 
using SI-NDVI imaging, which is both simpler to use and more cost efficient than 
traditional dual-image NDVI or hyper-spectral imaging.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The root apex is an important region involved in 
environmental sensing, but comprises a very small part of the root. Obtaining 
root apex transcriptomes is therefore challenging when the samples are limited. 
The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was 
examined, comparing RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to microarrays in characterizing 
genes that are relevant to spaceflight.
METHODS: Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col-0) roots were sectioned into 
Zone 1 (0.5 mm; root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone 2 (1.5 mm; transition, 
elongation, and growth-terminating zone). Differential gene expression in each 
was compared.
RESULTS: Both microarrays and RNA-Seq proved applicable to the small samples. A 
total of 4180 genes were differentially expressed (with fold changes of 2 or 
greater) between Zone 1 and Zone 2. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel 
transcriptionally active regions were identified by RNA-Seq that were not 
detected in microarrays. However, microarrays detected spaceflight-relevant 
genes that were missed in RNA-Seq.
DISCUSSION: Single root tip subsections can be used for transcriptome analysis 
using either RNA-Seq or microarrays. Both RNA-Seq and microarrays provided novel 
information. These data suggest that techniques for dealing with small, rare 
samples from spaceflight can be further enhanced, and that RNA-Seq may miss some 
spaceflight-relevant changes in gene expression.

Plants grown in spaceflight experience novel environmental signals, including 
those associated with microgravity and ionizing radiation. Spaceflight triggers 
a response involving transcriptional re-programming and altered cell morphology, 
though many aspects of this response remain uncharacterized. We analyzed the 
spaceflight-induced transcriptome with a focus on genes that undergo alternative 
splicing to examine differential splicing associated with spaceflight-an 
unstudied characteristic of the molecular response to spaceflight exposure. RNA 
sequence data obtained during the APEX03 spaceflight experiment that was 
collected from two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes at two seedling stages grown 
onboard the International Space Station, or as ground controls at Kennedy Space 
Center, were re-examined to detect alternative splicing differences induced by 
spaceflight. Presence/absence variation analysis was used to identify putative 
expression-level differences in alternatively spliced isoforms between 
spaceflight and ground controls and was followed by analysis of significant 
differential alternative splicing. This study provides the first evidence of a 
role for alternative splicing in the molecular processes of physiological 
adaptation to the spaceflight environment.

The EDEN ISS greenhouse is a space-analog test facility near the German Neumayer 
III station in Antarctica. The facility is part of the project of the same name 
and was designed and built starting from March 2015 and eventually deployed in 
Antarctica in January 2018. The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on 
February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the 
facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future 
plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality 
and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human 
factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the 
determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this 
topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops 
were grown on the 12.5 m2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of 
crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there 
were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of 
this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total 
more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse 
facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), 
leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of 
herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points 
for the crops were 330-600 μmol/(m2*s) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 
1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day. The overall yearly productivity 
of the EDEN ISS greenhouse in 2018 was 27.4 kg/m2, which is equal to 0.075 
kg/(m2*d). This paper shows in detail the data on edible and inedible biomass 
production of each crop grown in the EDEN ISS greenhouse in Antarctica during 
the 2018 season.

The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the 
long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, 
spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall 
remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological 
adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and 
spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct 
tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight 
study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell 
wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression 
patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing 
pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a 
skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions 
by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell 
wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in 
different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test 
of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In 
this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and 
markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. 
The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 
wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. 
Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all 
genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had 
almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d 
seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways 
represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to 
physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than 
wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight 
adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the 
loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related 
response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to 
spaceflight adaptation.

The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To 
address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) 
from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were 
investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of 
degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a 
reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage 
matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that 
degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to 
microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC 
flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with 
a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages 
respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the 
biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the 
differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of 
microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, 
but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the 
unloading of microgravity. We speculate that the maintenance of physiological 
loading on AC during spaceflight will minimize AC damage.

Spaceflight imposes several unique stresses on biological life that together can 
have a profound impact on the homeostasis between eukaryotes and their 
associated microbes. One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter 
host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent 
sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that 
these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the 
regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various 
environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency 
of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards 
disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe 
interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental 
stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and 
mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer 
duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial 
fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis 
between humans, plants and their respective microbiomes.

Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated 
host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data 
are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush 
border. The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border 
that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur 
on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the 
environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase 
in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related 
and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. 
Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also 
efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts. Manipulation 
of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that 
this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, 
symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that 
accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced 
solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data 
demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the 
brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the 
regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.

Microbes have been critical drivers of evolutionary innovation in animals. To 
understand the processes that influence the origin of specialized symbiotic 
organs, we report the sequencing and analysis of the genome of Euprymna 
scolopes, a model cephalopod with richly characterized host-microbe 
interactions. We identified large-scale genomic reorganization shared between E. 
scolopes and Octopus bimaculoides and posit that this reorganization has 
contributed to the evolution of cephalopod complexity. To reveal genomic 
signatures of host-symbiont interactions, we focused on two specialized organs 
of E. scolopes: the light organ, which harbors a monoculture of Vibrio fischeri, 
and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG), a reproductive organ containing a 
bacterial consortium. Our findings suggest that the two symbiotic organs within 
E. scolopes originated by different evolutionary mechanisms. Transcripts 
expressed in these microbe-associated tissues displayed their own unique 
signatures in both coding sequences and the surrounding regulatory regions. 
Compared with other tissues, the light organ showed an abundance of genes 
associated with immunity and mediating light, whereas the ANG was enriched in 
orphan genes known only from E. scolopes Together, these analyses provide 
evidence for different patterns of genomic evolution of symbiotic organs within 
a single host.

Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology 
of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well 
understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of 
Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio 
fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is 
known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is 
accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide 
evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS 
released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under 
modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of 
outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar 
motility. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of 
their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but 
levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. 
Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of V. 
fischeri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more 
susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like 
their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under 
microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host 
health during spaceflight.

Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system 
among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological 
traits enables complex behaviors. The genomic basis underlying these innovations 
remains unknown. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid 
Euprymna scolopes, we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory 
organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have 
been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the 
emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters 
(microsyntenies). Such novel microsyntenies correspond to topological 
compartments with a distinct regulatory structure and contribute to complex 
expression patterns. In particular, we identify a set of microsyntenies 
associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) broadly enriched in cephalopod 
nervous system expression. We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental 
to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling 
will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations.

BACKGROUND: Spaceflight is a novel and profoundly stressful environment for 
life. One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal 
physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of 
normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the 
interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of 
microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such 
as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the 
bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio 
fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how 
this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes.
RESULTS: Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex 
network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and 
intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled 
microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity 
controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and 
executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed 
heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could 
be mitigated using caspase inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity 
alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression 
and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled 
microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically 
inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling 
cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining 
animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.

Three-dimensionally woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds were 
combined with adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to engineer mechanically 
functional cartilage constructs in vitro. The specific objectives were to: (i) 
produce PCL scaffolds with cartilage-like mechanical properties, (ii) 
demonstrate that hMSCs formed cartilage after 21 days of culture on PCL 
scaffolds, and (iii) study effects of scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly 
woven), culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor), and medium 
composition (chondrogenic additives with or without serum). Aggregate moduli of 
21-day constructs approached normal articular cartilage for tightly woven PCL 
cultured in bioreactors, were lower for tightly woven PCL cultured statically, 
and lowest for loosely woven PCL cultured statically (p<0.05). Construct DNA, 
total collagen, and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) increased in a manner dependent on 
time, culture vessel, and medium composition. Chondrogenesis was verified 
histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline-like matrix that immunostained 
for collagen type II but not type I. Bioreactors yielded constructs with higher 
collagen content (p<0.05) and more homogenous matrix than static controls. 
Chondrogenic additives yielded constructs with higher GAG (p<0.05) and earlier 
expression of collagen II mRNA if serum was not present in medium. These results 
show feasibility of functional cartilage tissue engineering from hMSC and 
3D-woven PCL scaffolds.

Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven 
poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue 
engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives 
can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, 
mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D 
poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded 
on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or 
osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression 
were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, 
and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed extracellular 
matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, 
hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended 
on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects 
(all p < 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the 
order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear 
moduli of 0.15, 0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was 
characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with 
sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor 
alpha 1 (Cbfα1)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and 
osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. 
Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and 
regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered 
cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold. These findings merit consideration 
when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair.

The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of 
spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, 
insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological 
responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions 
during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota 
and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of 
spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 
microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate 
metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. 
Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid 
metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. 
Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy 
metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the 
host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these 
interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration 
spaceflight feasibility.

While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during 
spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms 
underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different 
pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the 
mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, 
Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity 
(LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity 
as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a 
significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when 
infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens. Here, we report 
that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that 
the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can 
be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the 
substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth 
rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the 
addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in 
bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of 
aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an 
equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and 
glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of 
asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that 
L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure 
for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This 
investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway 
by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates 
of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a 
potential mitigation strategy.

A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall 
behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station 
(ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This 
strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, 
catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as 
F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with 
C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant 
tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain 
F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, 
while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella 
genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide 
identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described 
Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for 
strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 
(10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given 
the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species 
within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, 
with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no 
closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the 
whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. 
ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. 
rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella 
strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any 
other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. 
nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain 
F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.

BACKGROUND: Several investigations on the microbial diversity and functional 
properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out 
to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial 
population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet 
to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including 
phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial 
resistance, and virulence characteristics.
RESULTS: In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, 
in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 
MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel 
genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel bacterial species 
(Methylobacterium ajmalii). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; 
this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. 
Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. 
The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell 
wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in 
the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs 
were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 
2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, 
AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates 
and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes 
were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been 
predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze 
if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have 
variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related 
ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the 
variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The 
Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella 
strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed 
genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under 
microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here 
on Earth. Video Abstract.

The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, 
and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of 
these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and 
emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or 
inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and 
ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro 
studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote 
pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development 
and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. 
Such interventions include using Bacillus-based cleaning products on surfaces or 
integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its 
infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to 
reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although 
these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the 
microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol 
solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current 
understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes 
strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of 
antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Receptor-like activity evoked by extracellular ADP in Arabidopsis root epidermal 
plasma membrane. Plant Physiol. 2011;156:1375–85. doi: 10.1104/pp.111.174722.

Extracellular purine nucleotides appear capable of regulating plant development, 
defence and stress responses by acting in part as agonists of plasma membrane 
calcium channels. Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic 
stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate 
can also cause ATP accumulation around Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Release of 
ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the 
plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. 
Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium 
reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation 
in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could 
elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown 
previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species.

Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires 
tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that 
displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We 
identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 
(EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant 
phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE 
RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen 
species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar 
localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and 
ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling 
module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root 
tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that 
mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for 
antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously 
unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control 
of plant gravitropism.

Their sessile lifestyle means that plants have to be exquisitely sensitive to 
their environment, integrating many signals to appropriate developmental and 
physiological responses. Stimuli ranging from wounding and pathogen attack to 
the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil are frequently presented in 
a localized manner but responses are often elicited throughout the plant. Such 
systemic signaling is thought to operate through the redistribution of a host of 
chemical regulators including peptides, RNAs, ions, metabolites, and hormones. 
However, there are hints of a much more rapid communication network that has 
been proposed to involve signals ranging from action and system potentials to 
reactive oxygen species. We now show that plants also possess a rapid stress 
signaling system based on Ca(2+) waves that propagate through the plant at rates 
of up to ∼ 400 µm/s. In the case of local salt stress to the Arabidopsis 
thaliana root, Ca(2+) wave propagation is channeled through the cortex and 
endodermal cell layers and this movement is dependent on the vacuolar ion 
channel TPC1. We also provide evidence that the Ca(2+) wave/TPC1 system likely 
elicits systemic molecular responses in target organs and may contribute to 
whole-plant stress tolerance. These results suggest that, although plants do not 
have a nervous system, they do possess a sensory network that uses ion fluxes 
moving through defined cell types to rapidly transmit information between 
distant sites within the organism.

Gravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts 
in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin. 
Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 (zig-1), a mutant allele of VTI11, 
which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have 
fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in 
vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we 
determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller 
than 70 μm in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypocotyls. 
This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top of zig-1 
hypocotyls, which enhanced shoot gravitropism in zig-1 mutants. Live-cell 
imaging of zig-1 hypocotyl endodermal cells indicated that amyloplasts are 
trapped between juxtaposed vacuoles and their movement is severely restricted. 
Wortmannin-induced fusion of vacuoles in zig-1 seedlings increased the formation 
of transvacuolar strands, enhanced amyloplast sedimentation and partially 
suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 seedlings. Hypergravity 
conditions at 10 g were not sufficient to displace amyloplasts in zig-1, 
suggesting the existence of a physical tether between the vacuole and 
amyloplasts. Our results overall suggest that vacuole membrane remodeling may be 
involved in regulating the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts during 
graviperception.

Plants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate 
physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body, even to 
highly localized and quickly changing environmental stresses. The propagation of 
these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and 
hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytoplasmic 
Ca(2+) traveling throughout the plant. For the Ca(2+) wave system, the 
involvement of the vacuolar ion channel TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) has been 
reported. However, the precise role of this channel and the mechanism of 
cell-to-cell propagation of the wave have remained largely undefined. Here, we 
use the fire-diffuse-fire model to analyze the behavior of a Ca(2+) wave 
originating from Ca(2+) release involving the TPC1 channel in Arabidopsis 
(Arabidopsis thaliana). We conclude that a Ca(2+) diffusion-dominated 
calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism is insufficient to explain the 
observed wave transmission speeds. The addition of a ROS-triggered element, 
however, is able to quantitatively reproduce the observed transmission 
characteristics. The treatment of roots with the ROS scavenger ascorbate and the 
NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium and analysis of Ca(2+) wave propagation

background all led to reductions in Ca(2+) wave transmission speeds consistent 
with this model. Furthermore, imaging of extracellular ROS production revealed a 
systemic spread of ROS release that is dependent on both AtRBOHD and TPC1 These 
results suggest that, in the root, plant systemic signaling is supported by a 
ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism intimately involving ROS 
production by AtRBOHD and Ca(2+) release dependent on the vacuolar channel TPC1.

Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are essential for 
plant survival during episodes of environmental stress. Recent studies 
highlighted a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in mediating 
systemic responses and SAA during light stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
thaliana). These studies further identified the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE 
HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein as a key player in mediating rapid systemic ROS 
responses. Here, we report that tissue-specific expression of RBOHD in phloem or 
xylem parenchyma cells of the rbohD mutant restores systemic ROS signaling, 
systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of 
light stress. We further demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF are both required for 
local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis. Taken 
together, our findings highlight a key role for RBOHD-driven ROS production at 
the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis in mediating light stress-induced systemic 
signaling and SAA. In addition, they suggest that the integration of ROS, 
calcium, electric, and hydraulic signals, during systemic signaling, occurs at 
the vascular bundles.

Calcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic 
interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant 
defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing 
insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants. However, the role of 
calcium in vivo during biotic stress is still unclear. This protocol describes 
the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in 
plants during feeding by a hemipteran pest. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a 
small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making 
them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a 
biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response. In addition, 
fluorescent biosensors are revolutionizing the measurement of signaling 
molecules in vivo in both animals and plants. Expressing a GFP-based calcium 
biosensor, GCaMP3, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the 
real-time imaging of plant calcium dynamics during insect feeding, with a high 
spatial and temporal resolution. A repeatable and robust assay has been 
developed using the fluorescence microscopy of detached GCaMP3 leaves, allowing 
for the continuous measurement of cytosolic calcium dynamics before, during, and 
after insect feeding. This reveals a highly-localized rapid calcium elevation 
around the aphid feeding site that occurs within a few minutes. The protocol can 
be adapted to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, while 
the use of Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the rapid generation of mutants to 
facilitate the molecular analysis of the phenomenon.

Plants show a rapid systemic response to a wide range of environmental stresses, 
where the signals from the site of stimulus perception are transmitted to distal 
organs to elicit plant-wide responses. A wide range of signaling molecules are 
trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and electrical signaling ('trio signaling') 
appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular 
components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, 
such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 
1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell 
wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from 
cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information 
exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular 
route, or whether it provides an environment to facilitate transmission of 
regulators such as ROS or H+ remains to be determined. Similarly, the role of 
plasmodesmata as both conduits and gatekeepers for the propagation of rapid 
cell-to-cell signaling remains a key open question. Regardless of how signals 
move from cell to cell, they help prepare distant parts of the plant for 
impending challenges from specific biotic or abiotic stresses.

Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas 
plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved 
systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger 
long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental 
challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin 
RNA-based Arabidopsis library identifies a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant 
that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously defined wound signal 
essential for activating plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibits attenuation 
of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling 
molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger 
long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our findings 
offer new insights into highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by 
plants to defend against herbivory and pathogen invasion.

Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing 
opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International 
Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, 
and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold 
great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique 
environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often 
complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons 
that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel 
analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form 
provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational 
systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization 
environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these 
tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology 
spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space 
Transcriptome (TOAST) database 
(https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) to address this gap in 
our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database 
management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, 
and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships 
across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. 
TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
(NASA's) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a 
suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of 
responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user 
interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments 
using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to 
explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST 
confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such 
as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across 
multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration 
environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive 
gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial 
function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.

One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of 
Ca2+ into the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in 
cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling 
networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their 
duration, amplitude, and frequency. Despite the wealth of observations showing 
that the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca2+ transients, there remain 
limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca2+ transporters involved in 
shaping the cellular Ca2+ dynamics during the triggering of the defense response 
network. However, the autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel 
Ca2+ from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the 
vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic phenotypes. 
We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and 
ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling and related defense responses. The 
double-knockout aca4/11 exhibited increased basal Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ signals 
of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca2+ dynamics and 
associated defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing the aca4/11 
seedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal 
cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tonoplast also suppressed the 
aca4/11 phenotypes but not when a catalytically inactive mutant was used. These 
observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration is an 
integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of 
tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps does not require specific regulatory elements not 
found in plasma membrane-localized pumps.

Plants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to 
rapid, plant-wide responses. In addition to the redistribution of chemical 
messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a 
communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, 
reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been 
discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each 
second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries 
behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive 
oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore 
channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all 
required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their 
distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of 
hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns 
of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of 
perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of 
plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single 
leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before 
it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.

In addition to microgravity, spaceflight simultaneously exposes biology to a 
suite of other stimuli. For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing 
radiation environments that significantly differ in both quality and quantity 
from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure 
during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting 
progress towards defining how radiation affects organisms against the unique 
background of spaceflight. To help address this challenge, we have developed the 
Rad-Bio-App. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from 
experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user 
to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and 
through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, 
graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and 
non-specialist researchers to visualize, and understand the impact of ionizing 
radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceflight.

A plant's oxygen supply can vary from normal (normoxia) to total depletion 
(anoxia). Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (Oryza 
sativa) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and 
transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia 
tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this 
process is poorly understood. Four functional cation/proton exchangers (CAX1-4) 
in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the 
vacuole. Our results demonstrate that cax1 mutants are more tolerant to both 
anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, 
RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1-mediated anoxia 
changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered 
metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, 
and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing 
genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in 
cax1 during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole 
are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation 
to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that cax1 anoxia response pathway could 
be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair 
production agriculture.

Spaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the 
effects on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the 
influence of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help 
understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study 
compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight 
experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing 
significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using 
a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq 
datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the 
robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with 
extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with 
these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., 
microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have 
important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions 
to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high 
similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, 
such as plant age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then 
helps reduce the complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made 
between experiments with very different designs.

Osteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone 
loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is 
known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively 
low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of 
skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 
0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy (137)Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of 
irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify 
microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy 
caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only 
evident at longer times in controls (4 months). Ex vivo bone cell 
differentiation from the marrow was unaffected by gamma radiation. In 
conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 
10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during 
progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis.

Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase 
bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue 
leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in 
rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body 
irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate 
osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), 
male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays ((137)Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) 
or heavy ions ((56)Fe, 600MeV, 0.50-1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either 
a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates 
over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized 
tissue were harvested 4 h-7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt 
(2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in 
the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of 
nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. 
Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron 
exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation 
preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic 
cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, 
and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, 
Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the 
marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, strongly 
correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1, Csf1, Tnf, and Rankl. Radiation 
exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We 
conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal 
elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and 
mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that 
lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account 
for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture 
following exposure to ionizing radiation.

BACKGROUND: Even with recent scientific advancements, challenges posed by 
limited resources and capabilities at the time of sample dissection continue to 
limit the collection of high quality tissues from experiments that can be 
conducted only infrequently and at high cost, such as in space. The resources 
and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and 
duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample 
quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be 
achieved.
OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample 
recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to 
both ground based and spaceflight studies. The first objective was to determine 
the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and 
storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and 
spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods 
that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long 
duration storage in situ at -80°C.
METHODS: Tissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time 
points post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for up to 11 months. In some 
experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored 
at -80°C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA 
Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the 
quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes 
(catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH).
RESULTS: Fresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored 
up to 11 months at -80°C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of 
either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were 
similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at 
any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for 
up to 7 months at -80°C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue 
analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 
6-7 months of storage at -80°C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues 
such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the 
carcasses frozen for 2.5 months.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for 
spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high 
quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed 
preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional 
tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even 
following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80°C. These findings have 
relevance both to high value, ground-based experiments when sample collection 
capability is severely constrained, and to spaceflight experiments that entail 
on-orbit sample recovery by astronauts.

BACKGROUND: Prolonged spaceflight is known to cause vascular deconditioning and 
remodeling. Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to 
result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the 
cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded 
rats.
METHODS: Firstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to 
identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats 
subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for 
artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R 
package ""Cellchat"" was used to reveal ligand-receptor cellular communication. At 
last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to 
predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading.
RESULTS: Clustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum 
of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased 
percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and 
FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes 
specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several 
gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. 
Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression 
variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and 
fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and 
cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular 
interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, 
underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several 
TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling 
process under simulated microgravity conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive 
arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene 
profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, 
cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also 
included in this work. The findings provide a reference for future research on 
vascular deconditioning following long-duration spaceflight.

Spaceflight entails exposure to numerous environmental challenges with the 
potential to contribute to both musculoskeletal and vascular dysfunction. The 
purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and 
radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the 
level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceflight and 
ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental 
stresses influence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative 
stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular 
defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, 
are useful for both screening and developing interventions against 
spaceflight-induced deficits in bone and vascular function.

The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the 
cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its 
application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system 
responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed 
animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and 
physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU 
variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no 
systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social 
isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of 
social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a 
refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate 
social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We 
conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly 
or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed 
expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) 
controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to 
matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4+ T cells in singly housed, 
but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass 
in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased 
adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone 
levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal 
responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social 
environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings 
show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to 
HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying 
possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.

Animal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged 
spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth 
orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by 
return to Earth. For NASA's Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk 
C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then 
resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. 
Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining 
tissues frozen in situ for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video 
health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did 
not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus 
weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight 
displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, 
whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than 
respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme 
activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, 
this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration 
experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering 
standard indices of chronic stress.

KEY POINTS: Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a result of disuse. Although 
several studies have established that a decrease in protein synthesis and 
increase in protein degradation lead to muscle atrophy, little is known about 
the triggers underlying such processes. A growing body of evidence challenges 
oxidative stress as a trigger of disuse atrophy; furthermore, it is also 
becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a causative role in 
determining muscle atrophy. Mitochondrial fusion and fission have emerged as 
important processes that govern mitochondrial function and PGC-1α may regulate 
fusion/fission events. Although most studies on mice have focused on the 
anti-gravitary slow soleus muscle as it is preferentially affected by disuse 
atrophy, several fast muscles (including gastrocnemius) go through a significant 
loss of mass following unloading. Here we found that in fast muscles an early 
down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins, through concomitant AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) activation, can activate catabolic systems, and ultimately 
cause muscle mass loss in disuse. Elevated muscle PGC-1α completely preserves 
muscle mass by preventing the fall in pro-fusion protein expression, AMPK and 
catabolic system activation, suggesting that compounds inducing PGC-1α 
expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy.
ABSTRACT: The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It 
is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways 
controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction 
plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here 
we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to 
mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower 
mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 
7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H2 O2 accumulation and 
no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system 
efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A 
defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred 
together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of 
unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, 
suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the 
role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because 
of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α 
overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins 
(Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible 
expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle 
mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity 
were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be 
useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.

Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, 
including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, 
astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, 
we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or 
combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female 
wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 
days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated 
microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines 
associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model 
for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted 
overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are 
protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in 
cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS 
signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, 
isolation, and confinement on Earth.

N(6)-threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that 
is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at 
position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate 
anticodon-codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have 
focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an 
extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis 
factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with 
allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even 
during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation 
of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants 
demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the 
biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic 
masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic 
generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other 
phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue 
and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs 
are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1, whereas nonproliferating tissues are 
less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many 
tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size 
during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific 
requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into 
the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal 
development and disease.

The evolutionary success of parasitoid wasps, a highly diverse group of insects 
widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history strategies in 
conflict with those of their hosts [1]. Drosophila melanogaster is a natural 
host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina. Attack by L. boulardi (Lb), a 
specialist wasp to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated 
humoral and cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate 
Lb eggs and embryos [2-5]. L. heterotoma (Lh), a generalist wasp, kills larval 
blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked virus-like 
particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to wasps' successful 
parasitism of Drosophila [6], but the composition of VLPs and their biotic 
nature have remained mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack 
viral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (1) the eukaryotic vesicular 
transport system, (2) immunity, and (3) previously unknown proteins. These novel 
proteins distinguish Lh from Lb VLPs; notably, some proteins specific to Lh VLPs 
possess sequence similarities with bacterial secretion system proteins. 
Structure-informed analyses of an abundant Lh VLP surface and spike-tip protein, 
p40, reveal similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD and IpaD of 
Gram-negative bacterial type-3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and 
deliver virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that Lh VLPs 
represent a new class of extracellular organelles and share pathways for protein 
delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and bacterial surface secretion 
systems. Given their mixed prokaryotic and eukaryotic properties, we propose the 
term mixed-strategy extracellular vesicle (MSEV) to replace VLP.

This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila 
melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to 
synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, 
since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been 
identified. Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches 
to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive 
sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share 
low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila 
candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of 
the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture 
and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of 
potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural 
models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising 
degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for 
functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any 
suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology 
models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D. 
melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or 
eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or 
novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in 
insects-predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics. 
Such experimental analysis of eicosanoid biology in a simple model organism will 
have high relevance to human development and health.

Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of 
their Drosophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into 
the larval hosts' body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, 
mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as 
virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. 
heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still 
remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we 
identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, 
infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. 
Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An 
enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these 
structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the 
whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. 
heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the 
genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of 
MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical 
inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they 
suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune 
suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. 
These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and 
related wasp species.

While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after 
spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are 
many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex 
environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only 
is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are 
significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. 
In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was 
significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the 
International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased 
virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial 
cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in 
bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground 
using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria 
was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for 
the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to 
the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor 
contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected 
with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later 
timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in 
vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes 
occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel 
mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.

The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. 
They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with 
proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions 
with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune 
suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter 
and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker 
for L. heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are 
readily distributed within the hosts' hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around 
the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the 
larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. The PSC serves as 
a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, 
the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into 
lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and 
block parasite development. We found that L. heterotoma infection disassembles 
the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. 
Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely 
intact in the face of L. heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval 
lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once 
inside, L. heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and 
phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence 
as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic 
lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., 
(a) phagocytosis of the wasp's immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor 
differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These 
results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted 
for destruction. The parasite's simultaneous and multipronged approach to block 
cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks 
the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation 
necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, 
our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph 
gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L. 
heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their 
understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and 
biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.

As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on 
many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. The parasitoids produce 
specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their 
venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, 
including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved 
inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse 
taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT's 36-residue core knottin 
fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a 
Cation-Polar-Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate 
antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of 
ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and 
arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity 
with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the 
Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly's 
Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our 
results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The 
prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the 
knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is 
important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly 
conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin 
binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for 
therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure-function 
relationships will advance novel drug design.

While fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system 
dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems' interactions with 
natural parasites in space are lacking. Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood 
cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized 
ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing 
mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space 
in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden 
increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control 
flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their 
essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly 
hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the 
expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with 
novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable 
for host-parasite studies on Earth.

While fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system 
dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems' interactions with 
natural parasites in space are lacking. Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood 
cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized 
ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing 
mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space 
in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden 
increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control 
flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their 
essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly 
hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the 
expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with 
novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable 
for host-parasite studies on Earth.

During space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental 
stresses, microgravity (μG) and space radiation. One of the fundamental 
questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, 
many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated 
μG on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we 
have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μG. However, our 
knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to 
the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is 
available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and 
μG. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in 
cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the 
simulated μG conditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of 
CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and μG simultaneously compared to 
CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose 
response data on space radiation obtained at the 1G condition could lead to the 
underestimation of astronauts' potential risk for health deterioration, 
including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on 
the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μG conditions.

Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems 
including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more 
subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to 
measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the 
molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative 
assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed 
robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 
homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of 
essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as 
strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and 
heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well 
as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive 
stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments 
were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on 
the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of 
spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and 
changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may 
negatively affect cell fitness.

Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human 
cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain 
conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or 'giant' colonies 
on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical 
processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer 
pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified 
structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia 
production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are 
key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways 
in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by 
experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and 
application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including 
colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress 
as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia 
dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of 
random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and 
simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. 
These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique 
response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which 
regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both 
convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to 
our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony 
differentiation.

Understanding genome wide, tissue-specific, and spaceflight-induced changes in 
gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. Transcriptome 
analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in 
space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a 
gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 
days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of 
liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we 
tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated 
in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were 
tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same 
four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and 
nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell 
differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.

University Electric Teaching Hospital, Beijing, China.

RATIONALE: Central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by Cryptococcus 
albidus are rarely reported, but are often associated with high mortality rates. 
Clinical data on the appropriate use of liposomal-amphotericin B (liposomal-AmB) 
with cryptococcal meningitis are limited. Here, we report for the first time the 
efficacious and safe use of the ideal bodyweight to calculate the dose of 
liposomal-AmB for a severely obese patient with C albidus meningitis. We also 
review the cases of CNS infection caused by C albidus and its related species.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A severely obese female patient was admitted to neurosurgical 
ward with lesions in the intracranial space and accompanying headache. Brain 
magnetic resonance imaging revealed prominent lesions in the right parietal and 
left frontal insular region. After glioma resection, C albidus was isolated from 
her cerebrospinal fluid samples.
DIAGNOSES, INTERVENTIONS, AND OUTCOMES: She diagnosed histopathologically with a 
Cryptococcus species infection. The culture from her cerebrospinal fluid sample 
showed the growth of yeast-like colonies, which were identified as C albidus 
with mass spectrometry. She was treated with liposomal-AmB (50 mg day-1 
intravenously) plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g day-1 orally in 4 divided doses) for 
6 weeks. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge.
LESSONS: CNS infections of C albidus were uncommon. Using ideal bodyweight to 
calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB should be considered for severely obese 
patients with C albidus meningitis.

A study was conducted to evaluate the three-dimensional clinostat simulated 
microgravity effect on mouse models, focusing on the central nervous system. 
Eighteen mice were divided into three groups: control, survival box, and 
clinostat + survival box. Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain 
transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. 
Results showed decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone 
loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain transcriptome, and altered metabolic 
pathways in serum and gut microbiota in clinostat-treated mice. The model 
closely mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes, suggesting its value 
in studying microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the 
need for attention to emotional changes in space.

Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can 
perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial 
cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) 
remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect 
the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM 
viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of 
CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a 
three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear 
stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and 
iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced 
by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50-250 
mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent 
cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static 
and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted 
in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found 
under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a 
mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the 
fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in 
vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results 
indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high 
shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro 
studies.

IMPORTANCE: At present, there is no consensus on the concentration of 
epinephrine/physiological saline for subcutaneous injection into external 
auditory canal (EAC) under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery. A 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) research is needed to provide reference, as 
this concentration can provide satisfactory surgical field clarity while 
maintaining patients' hemodynamic stability.
OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the effect of subcutaneous injection of different 
concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline into EAC under general 
anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics.
DESIGN: This double-blind, RCT study was about the effect of topical epinephrine 
injection in otoendoscopic surgery.
SETTING: This study was conducted at a single institution.
PARTICIPANTS: This study included 168 patients conformed to the inclusion 
criteria.
INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive different concentrations of 
epinephrine/physiological saline injection (1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, or 
1:40,000) into the junction of bone and cartilage at posterior wall of EAC 
during surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical field clarity was assessed with surgical field 
clarity grading scale and tympanic membrane flap flipping time. Hemodynamic 
changes were monitored by clinical parameters of blood pressure, heart rate, and 
ST segment of ECG.
RESULTS: There were no statistically-significant differences in surgical field 
clarity grade (P = .577) and tympanic membrane flap flipping time (P = .490) 
among 4 concentration groups. Epinephrine injection did cause an increase in 
hemodynamic parameters when compared with baseline (P < .05). Compared with the 
relatively-lower concentration groups (1:20,000 and 1:40,000), the 
relatively-higher concentration groups (1:5000 and 1:10,000) had more 
significant and long-lasting effect until 30 minutes after injection.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Four concentration groups of topical epinephrine 
injection in otoendoscopic surgery have the same effect on surgical field 
clarity. For the stability of patients' hemodynamics, we would prefer to 
recommend the use of concentrations with minimal impact on hemodynamics, ranging 
from 1:20,000 to 1:40,000.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Prolonged microgravity exposure is associated with localized 
low back pain and an elevated risk of post-flight disc herniation. Although the 
mechanisms by which microgravity impairs the spine are unclear, they should be 
foundational for developing in-flight countermeasures for maintaining astronaut 
spine health. Because human spine anatomy has adapted to upright posture on 
Earth, observations of how spaceflight affects the spine should also provide new 
and potentially important information on spine biomechanics that benefit the 
general population.
PURPOSE: This study compares quantitative measures of lumbar spine anatomy, 
health, and biomechanics in astronauts before and after 6 months of microgravity 
exposure on board the International Space Station (ISS).
STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective longitudinal study.
SAMPLE: Six astronaut crewmember volunteers from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) with 6-month missions aboard the ISS comprised our 
study sample.
OUTCOME MEASURES: For multifidus and erector spinae at L3-L4, measures include 
cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and 
FCSA/CSA. Other measures include supine lumbar lordosis (L1-S1), active 
(standing) and passive (lying) flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for 
each lumbar disc segment, disc water content from T2-weighted intensity, 
Pfirrmann grade, vertebral end plate pathology, and subject-reported incidence 
of chronic low back pain or disc injuries at 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: 3T magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic fluoroscopy of the lumbar 
spine were collected for each subject at two time points: approximately 30 days 
before launch (pre-flight) and 1 day following 6 months spaceflight on the ISS 
(post-flight). Outcome measures were compared between time points using paired t 
tests and regression analyses.
RESULTS: Supine lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) by an average of 11% 
(p=.019). Active FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2-L3: 
-22.1%, p=.049; L3-L4: -17.3%, p=.016; L4-L5: -30.3%, p=.004). By contrast, no 
significant passive FE ROM changes in these discs were observed (p>.05). Disc 
water content did not differ systematically from pre- to post-flight. Multifidus 
and erector spinae changed variably between subjects, with five of six subjects 
experiencing an average decrease 20% for FCSA and 8%-9% for CSA in both muscles. 
For all subjects, changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in 
lordosis (r2=0.86, p=.008) and active FE ROM at L4-L5 (r2=0.94, p=.007). 
Additionally, changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA correlated with changes in lordosis 
(r2=0.69, p=.03). Although multifidus-associated changes in lordosis and ROM 
were present among all subjects, only those with severe, pre-flight end plate 
irregularities (two of six subjects) had post-flight lumbar symptoms (including 
chronic low back pain or disc herniation).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that multifidus atrophy, rather than intervertebral 
disc swelling, associated strongly with lumbar flattening and increased 
stiffness. Because these changes have been previously linked with detrimental 
spine biomechanics and pain in terrestrial populations, when combined with 
evidence of pre-flight vertebral end plate insufficiency, they may elevate 
injury risk for astronauts upon return to gravity loading. Our results also have 
implications for deconditioned spines on Earth. We anticipate that our results 
will inform new astronaut countermeasures that target the multifidus muscles, 
and research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back 
pain and disc injury.

Bone growth may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and 
head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and 
density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and 
interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution 
may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven 23-week-old, adult female 
wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of 
microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight female littermates served as 
ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 murine calvariae were imaged on 
a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was 
placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters 
were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), 
average cortical thickness (Ct.Th), and tissue mineral density (TMD). 
Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the 
spaceflight (SF) group compared to that of the ground control (GC) group, the 
mean BV±SD for the SF group was 1.904±0.842 mm3, compared to 1.758±0.122 mm3 for 
the GC group (p<0.05). Ct.Th demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099±0.006 
mm in the GC group to 0.104±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar 
between the two groups with 0.878±0.029 g/cm3 for the GC group and 0.893±0.028 
g/cm3 for the SF group (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes 
responsive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These 
findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate 
bone adaptation independent of skeletal loading by tissue.

STUDY DESIGN: This study is a repeated measures design to measure the lumbar 
spine's response to common backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back 
pain (ILBP) using upright magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine's response 
to backpack loads with upright MRI in children with ILBP to compare their 
results with previously published normal child data under the same conditions. 
We hypothesize that typical backpack loads will have a different effect on the 
lumbar spine of normal children and children with ILBP.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Research in normal children shows that backpack 
loads compress the lumbar intervertebral discs (IVDs), increase lumbar coronal 
deformity, and increase pain.
METHODS: Fifteen pediatric and adolescent patients with ILBP were selected. 
Patients were excluded if a spinal deformity, an underlying pathology, or known 
injury was identified. A 0.6-T upright MRI scanner imaged the subjects while in 
supine and standing positions wearing 0-kg, 4-kg, and 8-kg backpacks. IVD 
height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain score were recorded 
after each condition and compared using analysis of variances. We compared the 
above-mentioned variables between ILBP and normal subjects using generalized 
least squares models.
RESULTS: The cohort's mean age was 13 ± 3 years. The 4-kg and 8-kg backpacks 
only compressed the L5-S1 IVD relative to upright with no load. Subjects 
experienced increasing pain with increasing load. Load had no effect on lumbar 
lordosis or lumbar coronal deformity. Compared with normal children, children 
with ILBP experience significantly less disc compression at T12-L1 to L4-L5, 
less lumbar lordosis, and more pain with increasing load.
CONCLUSION: In children with ILBP, increasing backpack load compresses only the 
L5-S1 IVD. Compared with normal children, children with ILBP experience less 
lumbar IVD compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain due to increasing 
load suggesting altered mechanisms for load tolerance in children with ILBP.

Intervertebral disc herniation rates are quadrupled in astronauts following 
spaceflight. While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the 
effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. 
Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of 
tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion 
segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium 
controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens 
were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and 
adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to 
quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened 
the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the 
bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the 
growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the 
disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume 
fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the 
tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these 
results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine 
bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in 
astronauts.

Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from 
lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) 
spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. 
Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the 
body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing 
non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) 
and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial 
vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure 
compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined 
parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old 
C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19-20 week-old 
C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust 
isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces 
significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. 
Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to 
GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice 
calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and 
pro-osteogenic gene (BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN) expression in BION-M1 mice 
using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 
gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage 
between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests 
that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth 
in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated 
bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for 
long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.

Waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can 
cause hard-to-treat human lung infections. Astronaut health could therefore be 
compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with 
pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the 
physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled 
microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) 
using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation 
(normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, 
bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure 
times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 
days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to 
LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were 
more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma 
radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels 
for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, 
respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a 
downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased 
chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma 
factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In 
summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a 
nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during 
infection. SigH is also implicated in the M. marinum LSMMG transcriptome 
response.

Gravitropism describes curvature of plants in response to gravity or 
differential acceleration and clinorotation is commonly used to compensate 
unilateral effect of gravity. We report on experiments that examine the 
persistence of the gravity signal and separate mechanostimulation from 
gravistimulation. Flax roots were reoriented (placed horizontally for 5, 10 or 
15 min) and clinorotated at a rate of 0.5 to 5 rpm either vertically (parallel 
to the gravity vector and root axis) or horizontally (perpendicular to the 
gravity vector and parallel to the root axis). Image sequences showed that 
horizontal clinorotation did not affect root growth rate (0.81 ± 0.03 mm h-1) 
but vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by about 7%. The angular velocity 
(speed of clinorotation) did not affect growth for either direction. However, 
maximal curvature for vertical clinorotation decreased with increasing rate of 
rotation and produced straight roots at 5 rpm. In contrast, horizontal 
clinorotation increased curvature with increasing angular velocity. The point of 
maximal curvature was used to determine the longevity (memory) of the gravity 
signal, which lasted about 120 min. The data indicate that mechanostimulation 
modifies the magnitude of the graviresponse but does not affect memory 
persistence.

The significant horticultural crop, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. 
botrytis) is vulnerable to the excessive salt concentration in the soil, which 
contributes to its scaled-down growth and productivity, among other indices. The 
current study examines the efficacy of hydropriming, halopriming, and 
osmopriming on the physio-biochemical attributes and tolerance to salinity 
(100 mM NaCl) in cauliflower under controlled conditions. The results showed 
that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on 
cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, 
and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different 
priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of 
salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and 
physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline 
content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower 
seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 
15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high 
loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores 
for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated 
seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming 
treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of 
systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor 
germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically 
significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established 
the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better 
germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be 
used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.

Desiccation Mitigates Heat Stress in the Resurrection Fern, Pleopeltis 
polypodioides.

Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat 
especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected 
hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and 
dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated 
using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic 
indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and 
became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 
50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned 
partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) 
increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment 
lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed 
reduced Qy when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained 
metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in 
dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 
40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up 
to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty 
acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) 
and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) 
acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids 
decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry 
fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds.

Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa 
and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs 
at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative 
gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive 
and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1, PIN3, 
IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and 
concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 
(UBQ1) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was 
determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse 
suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of 
all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper 
flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription 
profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is 
controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial 
resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the 
examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison 
of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip 
tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and 
hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.

Directing plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes 
that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi- and 
phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that 
high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. 
Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of 
curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are 
amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and 
compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts 
size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under 
clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes 
were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced 
transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have 
opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive 
weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and 
mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead 
to incorrect interpretations.

The necessity to include plants as a component of a Bioregenerative Life Support 
System leads to investigations to optimize plant growth facilities as well as a 
better understanding of the plant cell membrane and its numerous activities in 
the signaling, transport, and sensing of gravity, drought, and other stressors. 
The cell membrane participates in numerous processes, including endo- and 
exocytosis and cell division, and is involved in the response to external 
stimuli. Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include 
specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane 
microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The composition, 
especially the sterol-dependent recruitment of specific proteins affects endo- 
and exo-membrane domains as well as plasmodesmata. The enhanced saturated fatty 
acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and 
reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical 
stress. These results can also be obtained with lipid-sensitive stains. The 
linkage of the CM to the cytoskeleton via rafts is part of the complex 
interactions between lipid microdomains, mechanosensitive ion channels, and the 
organization of the cytoskeleton. These intricately linked structures and 
functions provide multiple future research directions to elucidate the role of 
lipid rafts in physiological processes.

Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to 
mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism 
for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or 
stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel 
activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to 
the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of 
Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in 
plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form 
mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch 
clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel 
activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel 
had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies 
an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We 
found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which 
was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was 
reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive 
channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with 
the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening. The 
electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 reported here provides insight 
into the evolution of structure and function of this important family of 
proteins.

Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from 
innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct 
populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, 
the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show 
that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 
(S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or 
pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly 
impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect 
on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated 
by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease 
in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes 
mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings 
define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish 
the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain 
thresholds.

The oocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) comprise one of the most 
widely used membrane protein expression systems. While frequently used for 
studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the 
study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked, perhaps due to a 
relative abundance of native expression systems. Recent advances, however, have 
illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial 
mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for 
heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant 
mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes.

The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical 
meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin 
and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the 
developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status 
of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant 
exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and 
genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at 
the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed 
plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at 
the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor 
AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of 
cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell 
identity gene WUSCHEL Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus 
production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA 
biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are 
consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde 
signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.

Exposure to the microgravity conditions of spaceflight alleviates the load 
normally imposed by the Earth's gravitational field on the inner ear utricular 
epithelia. Previous ultrastructural investigations have shown that spaceflight 
induces an increase in synapse density within hair cells of the rat utricle. 
However, the utricle exhibits broad physiological heterogeneity across different 
epithelial regions, and it is unknown whether capabilities for synaptic 
plasticity generalize to hair cells across its topography. To achieve systematic 
and broader sampling of the epithelium than was previously conducted, we used 
immunohistochemistry and volumetric image analyses to quantify synapse 
distributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice 
exposed to spaceflight (a 15-day mission of the space shuttle Discovery). These 
measures were compared with similarly sampled Earth-bound controls. Following 
paraformaldehyde fixation and microdissection, immunohistochemistry was 
performed on intact specimens to label presynaptic ribbons (anti-CtBP2) and 
postsynaptic receptor complexes (anti-Shank1A). Synapses were identified as 
closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta. Epithelia from horizontal 
semicircular canal cristae served as ""within-specimen"" controls, whereas 
utricles and cristae from Earth-bound cohorts served as experimental controls. 
We found that synapse densities decreased in the medial extrastriolae of 
microgravity specimens compared with experimental controls, whereas they were 
unchanged in the striolae and horizontal cristae from the two conditions. These 
data demonstrate that structural plasticity was topographically localized to the 
utricular region that encodes very low frequency and static changes in linear 
acceleration, and illuminates the remarkable capabilities of utricular hair 
cells for synaptic plasticity in adapting to novel gravitational 
environments.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spaceflight imposes a radically different sensory 
environment from that in which the inner ear utricle normally operates. We 
investigated synaptic modifications in utricles from mice flown aboard a space 
shuttle mission. Structural synaptic plasticity was detected in the medial 
extrastriola, a region associated with encoding static head position, as 
decreased synapse density. These results are remarkably congruent with a recent 
report of decreased utricular function in astronauts immediately after returning 
from the International Space Station.

AIMS: To determine the short-term effects of simulated microgravity on 
mesenchymal stem cell behaviors-as a function of clinorotation speed-using 
time-lapse microscopy.
BACKGROUND: Ground-based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent 
effects of weightlessness in spaceflight using clinostats that continuously 
reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time-averaged 
nullification of gravity. In this work, we investigated the effects of 
clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior 
of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).
METHODS: We compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 
75 rpm over 8 h in a recently developed lab-on-chip-based clinostat system. 
Time-lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology 
during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by 
actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time-lapse light 
microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients.
RESULTS: Among clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater 
inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency (P<0.005), though 
average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control 
(P=0.794). Cells at 75 rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to 
re-spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not 
alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells 
exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by 
adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies. The angular 
frequency-dependence suggests that a cell's ability to sense the changing 
gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. For migration studies, 
cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile 
and exhibited retraction instead of migration.

INTRODUCTION: The difficulty in re-growing and mineralizing new bone after 
severe fracture can result in loss of ambulation or limb. Here we describe the 
sequential roles of FGF-2 in inducing gene expression, cell growth and BMP-2 in 
gene expression and mineralization of bone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The regulation of gene expression was determined using 
real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) and cell proliferation was measured by thymidine 
incorporation or fluorescent analysis of DNA content in MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like 
cells. Photomicroscopy was used to identify newly mineralized tissue and 
fluorescence was used to quantify mineralization.
RESULTS: Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) had the greatest ability to induce 
proliferation after 24 hours of treatment when compared to transforming growth 
factor beta (TGFβ, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), bone morphogenic 
protein (BMP-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or prostaglandin E₂ 
(PGE₂). We found that FGF-2 caused the most significant induction of expression 
of early growth response-1 (egr-1), fgf-2, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), tgfβ and 
matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3) associated with proliferation and expression 
of angiogenic genes like vascular endothelial growth factor A (vegfA) and its 
receptor vegfr1. We found that FGF-2 significantly reduced gene expression 
associated with mineralization, e.g. collagen type-1 (col1a1), fibronectin (fn), 
osteocalcin (oc), IGF-1, noggin, bone morphogenic protein (bmp-2) and alkaline 
phosphatase (alp). In contrast, BMP-2 significantly stimulated expression of the 
mineralization associated genes but had little or no effect on gene expression 
associated with growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability of FGF-2 to re-program a mineralizing gene expression 
profile to one of proliferation suggests that FGF-2 plays a critical role of 
osteoblast growth in early fracture repair while BMP-2 is instrumental in 
stimulating mineralization.

BACKGROUND: Nutritional factors are associated with reduced risk of prostate 
cancer progression, yet mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the effects of 
lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate 
microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveillance for low-burden prostate 
cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or fish oil supplements would 
down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) 
gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation (IGF-1) and 
inflammatory (COX-2) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We conducted a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial 
comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles (assessed by qRT-PCR) among 
men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 
3 g/day fish oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic 
fatty acids) or placebo.
RESULTS: Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to fish, and 26 to placebo), 
there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF-1 
expression level between the placebo and lycopene arms (p = 0.93) nor in COX-2 
expression between the placebo and fish arms (p = 0.99).
CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil 
did not significantly change IGF-1 and COX-2 gene expression in the normal 
prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer. Further 
analysis of global gene expression profiles may shed light on the bioactivity 
and relevance of these nutrients in prostate cancer.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, 
the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells 
(AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. Mechanisms regarding 
abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role 
and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in 
BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model 
and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the 
NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in 
public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in 
patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells 
increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at 
P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The 
administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could 
alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer 
administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive 
transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in 
hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on 
AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of 
iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under 
hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes 
were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We 
further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia 
environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC 
II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and 
T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an 
important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.

Mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell (ECs) function, and 
have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes 
associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to 
investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as 
determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial 
cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 
hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a 
significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression 
were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and 
width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient 
to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational 
loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.

BACKGROUND: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been 
associated with reduced mortality and inflammation in patients with 
cardiovascular disease. There are limited data on the effects of n-3 PUFA 
supplementation in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of 3 mo of high-dose oral n-3 PUFA 
supplementation on inflammation, endothelial function, and walking ability in 
patients with PAD.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with claudication received 4.4 g/d of fish oil or 
placebo for 3 mo. Outcomes measured included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
levels, the omega-3 index, endothelial function as measured via flow-mediated 
vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, and a 6-min walk test. Plasma 
levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) were measured by 
liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In patients treated with fish 
oil, the absolute mean omega-3 index significantly increased from baseline (fish 
oil: 7.2 ± 1.2%, P < 0.001; placebo: -0.4 ± 0.9%, P = 0.31; between-group 
P < 0.001). Furthermore, there were significant increases in several pathway 
markers of SPM biosynthesis, including several mono-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic 
acids and mono-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids. We also observed significant 
increases in the SPM lipoxin A5 (fish oil: 0.57 ± 0.70 pg/mL, P = 0.05; placebo: 
0.01 ± 0.38 pg/mL, P = 0.93; between-group P = 0.04) and resolvin E3 (fish oil: 
154 ± 171 pg/mL, P = 0.04; placebo: 32 ± 54 pg/mL, P = 0.08; between-group 
P = 0.04). There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein, flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, or 6-min 
walk test in the fish oil group.
CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil increases SPMs in plasma of patients with PAD. Further 
studies are required to determine whether these early changes translate to 
clinical improvements in patients with PAD.

Three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes leads to improved and prolonged 
synthetic and metabolic functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are 
unknown. In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in 
maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo, primary mouse 
hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or 
as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene 
expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct 
from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, 
they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with 
significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding 
sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target 
genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. 
Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal 
genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the 
importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular 
pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of 
biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical 
applications.

Altered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights 
dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term 
space exploration. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in 
microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on 
board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. 
Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during 
early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed 
under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR (n = 4). 
This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global 
microarray analysis showed significant (P < 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under 
microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples. EGR3, FASLG, BTG2, 
SPRY2, and TAGAP are biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with 
miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 
matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target 
genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates 
T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking 
translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms. Moreover, this study suggests that 
T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is 
self-limited by miR-21.

The health risks of a dysregulated immune response during spaceflight are 
important to understand as plans emerge for humans to embark on long-term space 
travel to Mars. In this first-of-its-kind study, we used adoptive transfer of 
T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells to track an in vivo 
antigen-specific immune response that was induced during the course of 
spaceflight. Experimental mice destined for spaceflight and mice that remained 
on the ground received transferred OT-II cells and cognate peptide stimulation 
with ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 plus the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl 
lipid A. Control mice in both flight and ground cohorts received monophosphoryl 
lipid A alone without additional OVA stimulation. Numbers of OT-II cells in 
flight mice treated with OVA were significantly increased by 2-fold compared 
with ground mice treated with OVA, suggesting that tolerance induction was 
impaired by spaceflight. Production of proinflammatory cytokines were 
significantly increased in flight compared with ground mice, including a 5-fold 
increase in IFN-γ and a 10-fold increase in IL-17. This study is the first to 
show that immune tolerance may be impaired in spaceflight, leading to excessive 
inflammatory responses.

This article is based on a lecture I presented as the recipient of the 2009 
Pritzker Distinguished Lecturer Award at the Biomedical Engineering Society 
annual meeting in October 2009. Here, I review more than thirty years of 
research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory 
that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their 
shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control 
of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell 
biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to 
experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find 
critical solutions. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to 
confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental 
control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the 
molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of 
the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical 
behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to 
discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as 
integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical 
conversion. In addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant 
unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators 
for non-invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as 
therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based 
nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities 
that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering 
and regenerative medicine.

The International Space Station (ISS) is a complex built environment physically 
isolated from Earth. Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of 
the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural 
complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we 
describe one crewmember's microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, 
skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during 
and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight 
different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. 
Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and 
samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The 
microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured 
using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore 
Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed 
that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are 
more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva 
samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember's skin samples are 
more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on 
the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on 
different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva 
samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. 
This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember's 
microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We observed that the microbiome 
of the surfaces inside the ISS resemble those of the crew's skin. These data 
support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of 
preventive measures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for 
long term space travel.

To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth's 
surface, we flew NASA's C-20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 
along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four 
different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft. Bioaerosols were 
analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to 
characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to 
experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at 
each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling 
days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing. 
The most proportionally abundant microbial genera were Mycobacterium and 
Achromobacter at 10,000 ft; Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter at 20,000 ft; 
Delftia and Pseudoperonospora at 30,000 ft; and Alcaligenes and Penicillium at 
40,000 ft. Culture-based detections also identified viable Bacillus 
zhangzhouensis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus spp. in the upper troposphere. To 
estimate bioaerosol dispersal, we developed a human exposure likelihood model 
(7-day forecast) using general aerosol characteristics and 
measured meteorological conditions. By coupling metagenomics to a predictive 
atmospheric model, we aim to set the stage for field campaigns that monitor 
global bioaerosol emissions and impacts.

BACKGROUND: The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built 
environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or 
from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The 
Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface 
study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome 
amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces 
over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to 
continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same 
locations, over another 14 months.
METHODS: Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and 
processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and 
controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable 
cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free 
DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated 
and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were 
cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results.
RESULTS: Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented 
bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface 
microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. 
Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant 
temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS 
antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with 
no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine 
antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with 
macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. 
Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 
82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for 
amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses 
showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis 
showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 105 cfu/m2 CONCLUSIONS: 
Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a 
comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, 
bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and 
resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and 
microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may 
help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface 
microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity. Video

Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common condition in aging, diabetes, and in long 
duration spaceflights due to microgravity. This article investigates multi-modal 
gene disease and disease drug networks via link prediction algorithms to select 
drugs for repurposing to treat skeletal muscle atrophy. Key target genes that 
cause muscle atrophy in the left and right extensor digitorum longus muscle 
tissue, gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and the left and right soleus muscles are 
detected using graph theoretic network analysis, by mining the transcriptomic 
datasets collected from mice flown in spaceflight made available by GeneLab. We 
identified the top muscle atrophy gene regulators by the Pearson correlation and 
Bayesian Markov blanket method. The gene disease knowledge graph was constructed 
using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. We computed node 
embeddings, random walk measures from the networks. Graph convolutional 
networks, graph neural networks, random forest, and gradient boosting methods 
were trained using the embeddings, network features for predicting links and 
ranking top gene-disease associations for skeletal muscle atrophy. Drugs were 
selected and a disease drug knowledge graph was constructed. Link prediction 
methods were applied to the disease drug networks to identify top ranked drugs 
for therapeutic treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy. The graph convolution 
network performs best in link prediction based on receiver operating 
characteristic curves and prediction accuracies. The key genes involved in 
skeletal muscle atrophy are associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative 
diseases. The drugs selected for repurposing using the graph convolution network 
method were nutrients, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory medications, and 
others related to insulin.

A detailed understanding of how spaceflight affects human health is essential 
for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive 
multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of internal 
tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome 
Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the 
International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma 
cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirms 
previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 
cell surface marker antibodies identifies a mitochondrial DNA-enriched fraction 
associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction 
reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial 
components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to 
mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board 
artificial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed 
mitochondrial responses.

A single exposure to hindlimb unloading leads to changes in body mass, body 
composition and bone, but the consequences of multiple exposures are not yet 
understood. Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one 
(1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading 
(HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched 
controls. In vivo µCT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and 
lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) 
and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU 
and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD 
were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the 
final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses diminished in mice 
undergoing their 2nd or 3rd HLU cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA 
cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different 
from age-matched controls after the final RA period. In contrast, upper hindlimb 
muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower than controls in all 
unloaded groups after the final RA period. These results suggest that tissues in 
the abdominal region are more resilient to multiple bouts of unloading and more 
amenable to recovery during reambulation than the peripheral musculoskeletal 
system.

Anthropologists frequently use the shaft bending strength index to infer the 
physical activity levels of humans living in the past from their lower limb bone 
remains. This index is typically calculated as the ratio of bone shaft second 
moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (i.e. I(max)/I(min)). 
Individuals with high I(max)/I(min) values are inferred to have been very 
active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been more 
sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal 
and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the 
results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which 
anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the 
first experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to 
simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, in an attempt to 
simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was removed from 
the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined 
with μCT. We found that while exercise resulted in significant enhancement of 
I(max) and I(min) compared with controls, it failed to significantly increase 
the I(max)/I(min)index. Similarly, stunted bone growth caused by unloading 
resulted in significantly diminished I(max) and I(min) compared with controls, 
but low activity did not lead to significantly decreased I(max)/I(min)compared 
with normal activity. Together, these results suggest that caution is required 
when the bone shaft bending strength index is used to reconstruct the activity 
levels of past humans.

Force magnitudes have been suggested to drive the structural response of bone to 
exercise. As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to 
functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in 
the capacity of marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells. 
Here, we investigate the relationship between bone adaptation and mesenchymal 
stem cell (MSC) responsivity in growing mice subject to exercise. First, using a 
force plate, we show that peak external forces generated by forelimbs during 
quadrupedal locomotion are significantly higher than hindlimb forces. Second, by 
subjecting mice to treadmill running and then measuring bone structure with μCT, 
we show that skeletal effects of exercise are site-specific but not defined by 
load magnitudes. Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated 
by running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure in 
either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular structure. In 
contrast, in the ulna, femur and tibia, exercise led to significant enhancements 
of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area. Trabecular structure was also 
enhanced by running in the femur and tibia. Finally, using flow cytometry, we 
show that marrow-derived MSCs in the femur are more responsive to 
exercise-induced loads than humeral cells, such that running significantly 
lowered MSC populations only in the femur. Together, these data suggest that the 
ability of the progenitor population to differentiate toward osteoblastogenesis 
may correlate better with bone structural adaptation than peak external forces 
caused by exercise.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) responding to mechanical cues generated by physical 
activity is critical for skeletal development and remodeling. Here, we utilized 
low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal 
and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D 
culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when 
LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane 
(vertical-LIV). All LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic 
differentiation, and upregulated genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. 
The cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs 
30 Hz) and when applied in the horizontal plane. Horizontal but not vertical LIV 
realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our 
results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary 
cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell's 
response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of 
intracellular forces. Transcriptional and structural changes in particular with 
horizontal LIV, together with the strong frequency dependency of the signal, 
emphasize the importance of intracellular cytoskeletal configuration in sensing 
and responding to high-frequency mechanical signals at low intensities.

Little is known about interactions between muscle and bone during the removal 
and application of mechanical signals. Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb 
unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous 
population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle 
are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. 
During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice 
lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. 
During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different 
rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not 
correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we 
found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five 
QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and 
cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The 
low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with 
the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the 
premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may 
need to be reassessed.

Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to 
fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in 
vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also 
been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis 
plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the 
spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on 
osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone 
resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis 
was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone 
by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, 
QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). 
Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing 
osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and µCT was used to 
determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and 
trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- 
and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic 
osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but 
remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of 
osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly 
increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05) and further 
increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production 
preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular 
surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in 
osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption 
at both sites. Finally, µCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition 
completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data 
indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in 
triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption 
leading to bone loss in disuse. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral

The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene 
expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on 
Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, 
resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical 
loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and 
differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to 
gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to 
understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 
g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic 
regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study 
included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or 
without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping 
shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or 
EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping 
compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more 
pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. 
More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis 
genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene 
Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, 
and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG 
promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; 
including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant 
epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression 
exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three 
branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In 
totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB 
development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells 
committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced 
changes to their transcriptome.

In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal 
disease that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms control 
A. fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use 
transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage 
behaviors in response to different A. fumigatus strains. We find that 
macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche 
for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting 
fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and 
neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as 
faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than 
slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient 
strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. 
Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a 
CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, 
further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of 
a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages 
in the persistence of A. fumigatus and highlight the ability of different A. 
fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.

increased exposure to UV radiation. Secondary metabolites (SMs) in spores, such 
as melanins, have been shown to protect spores from UV radiation in other fungi. 
To test the hypothesis that melanin and other known spore SMs provide UV 
protection to A. fumigatus isolates, we subjected SM spore mutants to UV-C 
radiation. We found that 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin mutants of two 
clinical A. fumigatus strains (Af293 and CEA17) but not an ISS-isolated strain 
(IF1SW-F4) were more sensitive to UV-C than their respective wild-type (WT) 
strains. Because DHN-melanin has been shown to shield A. fumigatus from the host 
immune system, we examined all DHN mutants for virulence in the zebrafish model 
of invasive aspergillosis. Following recent studies highlighting the pathogenic 
variability of different A. fumigatus isolates, we found DHN-melanin to be a 
virulence factor in CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 but not Af293. Three additional spore 
metabolites were examined in Af293, where fumiquinazoline also showed 
UV-C-protective properties, but two other spore metabolites, monomethylsulochrin 
and fumigaclavine, provided no UV-C-protective properties. Virulence tests of 
these three SM spore mutants indicated a slight increase in virulence of the 
monomethylsulochrin deletion strain. Taken together, this work suggests 
differential roles of specific spore metabolites across Aspergillus isolates and 
by types of environmental stress.IMPORTANCE Fungal spores contain secondary 
metabolites that can protect them from a multitude of abiotic and biotic 
stresses. Conidia (asexual spores) of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus 
synthesize several metabolites, including melanin, which has been reported to be 
important for virulence in this species and to be protective against UV 
radiation in other fungi. Here, we investigate the role of melanin in diverse 
isolates of A. fumigatus and find variability in its ability to protect spores 
from UV-C radiation or impact virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive 
aspergillosis in two clinical strains and one ISS strain. Further, we assess the 
role of other spore metabolites in a clinical strain of A. fumigatus and 
identify fumiquinazoline as an additional UV-C-protective molecule but not a 
virulence determinant. The results show differential roles of secondary 
metabolites in spore protection dependent on the environmental stress and strain 
of A. fumigatus As protection from elevated levels of radiation is of paramount 
importance for future human outer space explorations, the discovery of small 
molecules with radiation-protective potential may result in developing novel 
safety measures for astronauts.

A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic 
tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, 
similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have 
revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled 
gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein 
that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and 
pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte 
misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are 
similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of 
both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin 
enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous 
and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. 
Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has 
been difficult to study in higher organisms.

Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in 
conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive 
phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their 
sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their 
surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in 
plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little 
is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and 
gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular 
Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the 
interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis 
thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and 
phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity 
gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light 
phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, 
and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment 
of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in 
response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of 
roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was 
gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light 
phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also 
confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown 
to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the 
first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in 
Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between 
these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities.

Discovering the adaptation mechanisms of plants to the space environment is 
essential for supporting human space exploration. Transcriptomic analyses allow 
the identification of adaptation response pathways by detecting changes in gene 
expression at the global genome level caused by the main factors of the space 
environment, namely altered gravity and cosmic radiation. This article reviews 
transcriptomic studies carried out from plants grown in spaceflights and in 
different ground-based microgravity simulators. Despite differences in plant 
growth conditions, these studies have shown that cell wall remodeling, oxidative 
stress, defense response, and photosynthesis are common altered processes in 
plants grown under spaceflight conditions. European scientists have 
significantly contributed to the acquisition of this knowledge, e.g., by showing 
the role of red light in the adaptation response of plants (EMCS experiments) 
and the mechanisms of cellular response and adaptation mostly affecting cell 
cycle regulation, using cell cultures in microgravity simulators.

Tropisms are growth-mediated plant movements that help plants to respond to 
changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, as well 
as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that 
plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant 
response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light 
(phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, 
we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known 
molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight research 
done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through 
experiments carried out in the absence of a significant unilateral gravity 
vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity 
environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic 
cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which 
sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic 
competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, 
affecting the regulation of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light 
irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating 
effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, also are key 
mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space 
Station will clarify some of the mechanisms and molecular players of the plant 
responses to these environmental signals involved in tropisms and the cell 
cycle.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plants will play an important role in the future of space 
exploration as part of bioregenerative life support. Thus, it is important to 
understand the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on gene expression in 
plant development.
METHODS: We analyzed the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana using the 
Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware during Space Shuttle mission 
STS-131. The bioinformatics methods used included RMA (robust multi-array 
average), MAS5 (Microarray Suite 5.0), and PLIER (probe logarithmic intensity 
error estimation). Glycome profiling was used to analyze cell wall composition 
in the samples. In addition, our results were compared to those of two other 
groups using the same hardware on the same mission (BRIC-16).
KEY RESULTS: In our BRIC-16 experiments, we noted expression changes in genes 
involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, DNA repair, and cell wall 
structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. In 
addition, glycome profiling supported our expression analyses in that there was 
a difference in cell wall components between ground control and 
spaceflight-grown plants. Comparing our studies to those of the other BRIC-16 
experiments demonstrated that, even with the same hardware and similar 
biological materials, differences in results in gene expression were found among 
these spaceflight experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: A common theme from our BRIC-16 space experiments and those of the 
other two groups was the downregulation of water stress response genes in 
spaceflight. In addition, all three studies found differential regulation of 
genes associated with cell wall remodeling and stress responses between 
spaceflight-grown and ground control plants.

Introduction: Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced 
gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth's gravity is becoming a 
realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life 
support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among 
plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. 
Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space 
experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, 
and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, 
several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation 
with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for 
subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the 
HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further 
characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for 
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. Results: Differential gene expression analysis 
revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar 
protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, 
the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either 
micro-g, low-g level (< 0.1g) or the Moon g-level with 1g control conditions. 
Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes 
was similar in microgravity and the Moon g-level and increased in the 
intermediate g-level (< 0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the 
difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were 
differentially affected at each g-level: light and photosynthesis GO under 
microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses 
under low-g, and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and 
function under the Moon g-level. Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants 
under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be 
enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of 
gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense 
perturbation at the micro-g level, which shows an extensive stress response that 
is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell 
wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars 
gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.

Life on Earth has evolved under the influence of gravity. This force has played 
an important role in shaping development and morphology from the molecular level 
to the whole organism. Although aquatic life experiences reduced gravity 
effects, land plants have evolved under a 1-g environment. Understanding 
gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. One method 
of eliminating gravity''s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around 
the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and 
the centrifugal force of the moving object. This balance is often mistakenly 
referred to as microgravity, but is best described as weightlessness. In 
addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, 
random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been 
used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. 
However, these platforms do not reduce gravity but constantly change its 
direction. Despite these fundamental differences, there are few studies that 
have investigated the comparability between these platforms and weightlessness. 
Here, we provide a review of the strengths and weaknesses of these analogs for 
the study of plant growth and development compared to spaceflight experiments. 
We also consider reduced or partial gravity effects via spaceflight and analog 
methods. While these analogs are useful, the fidelity of the results relative to 
spaceflight depends on biological parameters and environmental conditions that 
cannot be simulated in ground-based studies.

Understanding plant adaptive responses to the space environment is a requisite 
for enabling space farming. Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant 
cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive 
process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be 
activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used 
mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes (NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar 
regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in adaptive 
response mechanisms to stress on Earth. Thus, we show that nucleolin 
stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by 
darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete 
response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA/NASA 
Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments, will determine the basis for the 
identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants 
in future space experiments.

Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital 
for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support 
systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the 
growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as ""water 
lentils"" or ""duckweed""), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an 
experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has 
been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of 
multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia 
globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial 
gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random 
positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we 
observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and 
morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of 
plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when 
compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed 
differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse 
gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to 
gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being 
slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop 
species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR 
remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the 
potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse 
gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food 
production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration 
missions.

Understanding how plants respond and adapt to extraterrestrial conditions is 
essential for space exploration initiatives. Deleterious effects of the space 
environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of 
cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression 
reprogramming. However, plants are capable of surviving and completing the 
seed-to-seed life cycle under microgravity. A key research challenge is to 
identify environmental cues, such as light, which could compensate the negative 
effects of microgravity. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity 
sensing in space was the major objective of the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth series 
of spaceflight experiments (2013-2018). Different g-levels were used, with 
special attention to micro-g, Mars-g, and Earth-g. In spaceflight seedlings 
illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated 
with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light 
partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the 
combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings 
as stressful. Two mutant lines of the nucleolar protein nucleolin exhibited 
differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation. This 
observation opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to 
be used in space colonization. Further transcriptomic studies at different 
g-levels showed elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression in 
microgravity, associated with disturbed nucleus-organelle communication, and the 
upregulation of genes encoding auxin and cytokinin hormonal pathways. At the 
Mars g-level, genes of hormone pathways related to stress response were 
activated, together with some transcription factors specifically related to 
acclimation, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial-g are able to acclimate 
by modulating genome expression in routes related to 
space-environment-associated stress.

Reduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceflight, and casting, causes 
rapid morphological changes in skeletal muscle: fiber atrophy and reduction of 
slow-twitch fibers. An emerging signaling event in response to unloading is the 
translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma to 
the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase 
and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOSμ translocation and 
muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. 
Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), 
and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-134 mitigated the 
unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle fiber atrophy and muscle 
fiber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOSμ immunolocalization at the sarcolemma 
of the soleus was reduced with HU, while nNOSμ protein content in the cytosol 
increased with unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol 
was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated dephosphorylation at 
Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress 
(4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits 
gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox, effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our findings 
are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ 
translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event 
during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological 
switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers.

Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical 
remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers 
accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis 
in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently 
reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase 
(MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and 
fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD would be 
causal in protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart. Hearts 
were extracted from young (8 months) wild-type, young mice overexpressing the 
Sod2 (MnSOD) gene, old (28 months) wild-type, and old transgenic mice. Left 
ventricle MnSOD protein levels were elevated in young mice overexpressing the 
Sod2 (MnSOD) gene and old transgenic mice. MnSODTg mice exhibited lower 
oxidative stress (total hydroperoxides, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-isoprostane) in 
the old group. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in 
MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (-65%), collagen-I, and 
transforming growth factor-β. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (-38%) and caspase-3 
cleavage (-41%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was 
mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type. We conclude that MnSOD 
elevation is indeed protective against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis 
in the aging heart.

Apoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. 
Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may 
contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric 
restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide 
significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. 
Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: 
AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. 
However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent 
apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown. Therefore, we 
tested the hypothesis that CR and WR with CR would ameliorate age-induced 
elevation of EndoG and AIF while protecting HSP27 and HSP70 levels in the 
plantaris. Male Fischer-344 rats were divided into 4 groups at 11weeks: ad 
libitum feeding until 6months (YAL); fed ad libitum until 24months old (OAL); 
8%CR to 24months (OCR); WR+8%CR to 24months (OExCR). Nuclear EndoG levels were 
significantly higher in OAL (+153%) than in YAL, while CR (-38%) and WR with CR 
(-46%) significantly attenuated age-induced increment in nuclear EndoG. HSP27 
(-63%) protein content and phosphorylation at Ser82 (-49%) were significantly 
lower in OAL than in YAL, while HSP27 protein content was significantly higher 
in OCR (+136%) and OExCR (+155%) and p-HSP27 (+254%) was significantly higher in 
OExCR compared with OAL, respectively. In contrast, AIF and HSP70 were unaltered 
by CR or WR with CR in aging muscle. These data indicate that CR and WR with CR 
attenuate age-associated upregulation of EndoG translocation in the nucleus, 
potentially involved with HSP27 signaling.

Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as 
sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In 
aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane 
that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if 
lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR+voluntary wheel 
running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling 
proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy 
membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided 
into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% 
caloric restriction (OCR); 24month old 8% caloric restriction+wheel running 
(OCRWR); and 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to 
determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane 
expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and 
α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric 
oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR 
provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In 
conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane 
repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly 
increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were 
effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers 
also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) 
subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal 
environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our 
results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are 
effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber 
membrane environment.

Mechanical unloading during microgravity causes skeletal muscle atrophy and 
impairs mitochondrial energetics. The elevated production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress 
protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. We tested 
the hypothesis that the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104 would rescue unloading-induced 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and 
soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory 
control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with 
SRT2104 (SIRT). Oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer capacities, H2O2 
production, and oxidative and antioxidant enzymes were quantified using 
high-resolution respirometry and colorimetry. In the gastrocnemius, (1) 
integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; 
(2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron 
transfer capacity (ECI+II) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative 
phosphorylation to ECI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of 
LEAK to ECI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. 
In both muscles, H2O2 production and concentration was greatest in SIRT, as was 
gastrocnemius superoxide dismutase activity. In the soleus, H2O2 concentration 
was greater in HU compared to CON. These results indicate that SRT2104 preserves 
mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, suggesting its potential to 
support healthy muscle cells in microgravity by promoting necessary energy 
production in mitochondria.

Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing 
tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the 
microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, 
causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, 
physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during 
spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that 
uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy 
and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. 
Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) 
stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were 
assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) 
experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days 
of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using 
ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased 
significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The 
hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were 
elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers 
IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT 
group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was 
significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated 
catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated 
proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic 
stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and 
myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.

Urine, humidity condensate, and other sources of non-potable water are processed 
onboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Water Recovery System (WRS) 
yielding potable water. While some means of microbial control are in place, 
including a phosphoric acid/hexavalent chromium urine pretreatment solution, 
many areas within the WRS are not available for routine microbial monitoring. 
Due to refurbishment needs, two flex lines from the Urine Processor Assembly 
(UPA) within the WRS were removed and returned to Earth. The water from within 
these lines, as well as flush water, was microbially evaluated. Culture and 
culture-independent analysis revealed the presence of Burkholderia, 
Paraburkholderia, and Leifsonia. Fungal culture also identified Fusarium and 
Lecythophora. Hybrid de novo genome analysis of the five distinct Burkholderia 
isolates identified them as B. contaminans, while the two Paraburkholderia 
isolates were identified as P. fungorum. Chromate-resistance gene clusters were 
identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from 
previously studied isolates recovered from the point-of-use potable water 
dispenser and/or current NCBI references, indicating that unique populations 
exist within distinct niches in the WRS. Beyond genomic analysis, fixed samples 
directly from the lines were imaged by environmental scanning electron 
microscopy, which detailed networks of fungal-bacterial biofilms. This is the 
first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the 
ISS. For all bacteria isolated, biofilm potential was further characterized, 
with the B. contaminans isolates demonstrating the most considerable biofilm 
formation. Moreover, the genomes of the B. contaminans revealed secondary 
metabolite gene clusters associated with quorum sensing, biofilm formation, 
antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. The potential production of these gene 
cluster metabolites was phenotypically evaluated through biofilm, 
bacterial-fungal interaction, and hemolytic assays. Collectively, these data 
identify the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche and novel area of 
biofilm growth within the WRS. Further investigation of these organisms and 
their resistance profiles will enable engineering controls directed toward 
biofilm prevention in future space station water systems.

We present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living 
Ecosystem Simulation), an extension of CFDEM®Coupling to model biological flows, 
growth, and mass transfer in artificial microgravity devices. For microbes that 
accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid 
environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of 
spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well 
ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES 
incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport 
within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). 
Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES 
employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical 
processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass 
transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict 
relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, 
and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically 
cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that 
the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when 
species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of 
other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product 
yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory 
experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity 
and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models 
creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological 
experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass 
transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.

The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility 
deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, 
closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth 
chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research 
during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS 
in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and 
SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese 
Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long 
hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both 
Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test 
examined the APH's ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, 
humidity, CO2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture 
using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The 
test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that 
scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod 
at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the 
three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and 
(3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., 
measure photosynthetic CO2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were 
grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and 
watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was 
assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large 
evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of 
transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the 
ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange 
measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were 
evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO2 drawdown 
technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO2 
increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can 
measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.

Control over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions in vivo in vascular 
plants was enigmatic until our discovery of dirigent proteins (DPs, from the 
Latin dirigere, to guide or align). The first three-dimensional structure of a 
DP ((+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group 
H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric structure with an 
eight-stranded β-barrel topology for each DP monomer. Each putative substrate 
binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too 
far apart for intermolecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each 
site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol 
radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six 
differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (+)- or 
(-)-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative binding site and region known to 
control stereoselectivity. DPs are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas 
dirigent domains/sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.

Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) 
biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
thaliana) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger 
reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by 
analyzing Arabidopsis ADT mutants using our phenomics facility and 
ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we 
describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and 
secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe 
biosynthesis in ADT mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically 
produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of 
transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron 
transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the 
thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the 
high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary 
metabolites in ADT mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, 
and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from 
aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative 
galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric 
monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates 
between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6, our most extreme ADT knockout mutant, 
which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. 
Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe 
metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for 
plant improvement.

Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase (ADT) knock-out (KO) mutants, with 
phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were 
studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall 
plant systems biology. Integrated ""omics"" analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, 
and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple ADT KO lines were 
conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog 
(GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome 
cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions 
affected. Network analysis of enzymes-highly correlated to stem lignin 
levels-deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or 
processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA 
transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work 
helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our 
data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional 
post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be 
considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more 
accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ, with 
new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant 
bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of 
proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to 
glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, 
phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO 
mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and 
galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many 
glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were 
decreased in the KO mutants.

AIMS: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of 
multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated 
whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in 
neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox 
metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent 
oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of 
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were 
less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences 
resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit 
radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a 
compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in 
antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background 
levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair 
novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation.
INNOVATION: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and 
the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a 
persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with 
impaired cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent 
oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times. Data suggest 
that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for 
mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of 
developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae.

The Last Mile in Beta-Cell Replacement Therapy for Type 1 Diabetes: Time to Grow

Beta cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is undergoing a 
transformative shift, driven by advances in stem cell biology, gene editing, and 
tissue engineering. While islet transplantation has demonstrated 
proof-of-concept success in restoring endogenous insulin production, its 
clinical impact remains limited by donor scarcity, immune rejection, and 
procedural complexities. The emergence of stem cell-derived beta-like cells 
represents a paradigm shift, with initial clinical trials showing promising 
insulin secretion in vivo. However, translating these breakthroughs into 
scalable, widely accessible treatments poses significant challenges. Drawing 
parallels to space exploration, this paper argues that while scientific 
feasibility has been demonstrated, true accessibility remains elusive. Without a 
strategic shift, beta cell therapy risks becoming an elite intervention, 
restricted by cost and infrastructure. Lessons from gene and cell therapies for 
rare diseases highlight the dangers of unsustainable pricing and limited market 
viability. To bridge the ""last mile"" a Quality by Design approach is proposed, 
emphasizing scalability, ease of use, and economic feasibility from the outset. 
By emphasizing practical implementation over academic achievements, corporate 
interests, market economics, or patent constraints, beta cell therapy can 
progress from proof-of-concept to a viable, widely accessible treatment.

The transcriptomic datasets of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana 
grown in the International Space Station provided by GeneLab have been mined to 
isolate the impact of spaceflight microgravity on gene expressions related to 
root growth. A set of computational tools is used to identify the hub genes that 
respond differently in spaceflight with controlled lighting compared to on the 
ground. These computational tools based on graph-theoretic approaches are used 
to infer gene regulatory networks from the transcriptomic datasets. The three 
main algorithms used for network analyses are LASSO, Pearson correlation, and 
the HITS algorithm. Graph-based spectral analyses reveal distinct properties of 
the spaceflight microgravity networks for the WS, Col-0, and mutant phyD 
ecotypes. The set of hub genes that are significantly altered in spaceflight 
microgravity are mainly involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, 
response to auxin, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Network analysis 
highlights five important root growth-regulating hub genes that have the highest 
outdegree distribution in spaceflight microgravity networks. These concerned 
genes coding for proteins are identified from the Gene Regulatory Networks 
(GRNs) corresponding to spaceflight total light environment. Furthermore, 
network analysis uncovers genes that encode nucleotide-diphospho-sugar 
interconversion enzymes that have higher transcriptional regulation in 
spaceflight microgravity and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis.

Ionizing radiation present in extraterrestrial environment is an important 
factor that affects plants grown in spaceflight. Pearson correlation-based gene 
regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions 
acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the 
networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage 
response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein-protein 
interactions in Arabidopsis reveals interaction profile similarities under low 
radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving 
non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. 
The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, 
AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. 
The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced 
genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development. Eighteen 
radiation-induced genes and sixteen non-radiation-induced gene players have been 
identified from the ATR/ATM protein interaction complexes involved in heat, 
salt, water, osmotic stress responses, and plant organogenesis. Network analysis 
and logistic regression ranking detected AT3G27060, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, and 
AT3G21280 as key gene players involved in DNA repair processes. High atomic 
weight, high energy, and gamma photon radiation result in higher intensity of 
DNA damage response in the plant resulting in elevated values for several 
network measures such as spectral gap and girth. Nineteen flavonoid and 
carotenoid pigment activations involved in pigment biosynthesis processes are 
identified in low radiation dose total light spaceflight environment but are not 
found to have significant regulations under very high radiation dose 
environment.

Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to 
environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present significant 
risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers. One CNS region of 
interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are 
sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. It is currently 
unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB 
volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle 
Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control 
mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that 
mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume 
relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), 
particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground 
mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium 
mice. However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not 
seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may have 
negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of AEM-Flight 
mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic cells relative to 
AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight 
have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into 
potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space 
missions.

PURPOSE: Space travel is associated with an exposure to low-dose rate ionizing 
radiation and the microgravity environment, both of which may lead to 
impairments in cardiac function. We used a mouse model to determine short- and 
long-term cardiac effects to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading; HU), 
continuous low-dose rate γ-irradiation, or a combination of HU and low-dose rate 
γ-irradiation.
METHODS: Cardiac tissue was obtained from female, C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month, 
4 months, and 9 months following the completion of a 21 day exposure to HU or a 
21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation (average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h 
to a total of 0.04 Gy), or a 21 day simultaneous exposure to HU and low-dose 
rate γ-irradiation. Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid 
chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell 
infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation 
potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group.
RESULTS: The combination of HU and γ-irradiation demonstrated the strongest 
increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after 
treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. On the other 
hand, no significant changes in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts was seen in any of the 
groups, at the measured endpoints. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein 
levels decreased 9 months after low-dose γ-radiation, no changes were observed 
in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the 
expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. 
Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all 
groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in 
α-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or 
% total collagen.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of 
small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte 
infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous 
exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. Results from the late observation time 
points suggest that the hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental 
conditions. However, further research is needed with larger numbers of animals 
for a more robust statistical power to fully characterize the early and late 
effects of simulated microgravity combined with exposure to low-dose rate 
ionizing radiation on the heart.

The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and 
functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present 
study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the 
structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the 
eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles 
were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male 
C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 
12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, 
mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/- 4 hours of splashdown, mice 
were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control 
(GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or 
normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) 
measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the 
mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in 
post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4-19.3 mmHg vs 
16.3-20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant 
apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to 
control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed 
that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared 
to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were 
also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell 
adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the 
BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic 
analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, 
cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were 
significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. 
These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure 
and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.

Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically 
focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. 
This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and 
combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated 
microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation 
(LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene 
expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation 
were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced 
representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene 
expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within 
single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined 
HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple 
altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of 
neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation 
following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves 
pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late 
onset neurological sequelae.

Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. 
The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene 
expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old 
adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to 
Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical 
environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/-4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular 
tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for 
genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous 
retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with 
retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods 
and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in 
chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. 
Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and 
increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, 
and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These 
results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of 
spaceflight and cause visual impairment.

There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue 
from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical 
procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body 
high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and 
blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) 
region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by 
fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated 
or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 
0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five 
days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular 
tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the 
number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that 
received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose (p < 0.05). 
Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative 
biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or 
fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 
0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), 
a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 
(ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion 
molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed 
in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was 
also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the 
expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of 
disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very 
limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to 
possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated 
that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated 
apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our 
study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these 
two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the 
retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated 
dose schedules.

It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in 
the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present 
study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated 
with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain 
tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space 
Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, 
mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A 
novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to 
evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 
differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat 
ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with 
cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly 
altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important 
for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. 
Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were 
significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune 
reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses 
and have an impact on the neuronal function.

The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity 
which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi-omics NASA 
GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 
21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months 
post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal 
profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, 
and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation 
difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. 
Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with 
activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and 
processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months 
post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and 
expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal 
function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the 
epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the 
retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular 
mechanisms at different post-exposure stages.

The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in 
ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to 
evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes 
in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on 
Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly 
injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before 
launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were 
maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, 
intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal 
function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded 
when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet 
monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG 
assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in 
body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight 
measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before 
launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and 
post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and 
saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal 
oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment 
significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data 
showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly 
decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat 
ground controls. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce 
oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and 
retinal function impairment.

Under conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. 
This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, 
one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. 
In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased 
significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° 
SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from 
+ 9.1° (± 4.4°) to + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell 
significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was not 
significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in 
either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching 
and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint 
to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For 
repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced 
independently of any changes in gravity.

Widespread generation and analysis of omics data have revolutionized molecular 
medicine on Earth, yet its power to yield new mechanistic insights and improve 
occupational health during spaceflight is still to be fully realized in humans. 
Nevertheless, rapid technological advancements and ever-regular spaceflight 
programs mean that longitudinal, standardized, and cost-effective collection of 
human space omics data are firmly within reach. Here, we consider the 
practicality and scientific return of different sampling methods and omic types 
in the context of human spaceflight. We also appraise ethical and legal 
considerations pertinent to omics data derived from European astronauts and 
spaceflight participants (SFPs). Ultimately, we propose that a routine omics 
collection program in spaceflight and analog environments presents a golden 
opportunity. Unlocking this bright future of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven 
analyses and personalized medicine approaches will require further investigation 
into best practices, including policy design and standardization of omics data, 
metadata, and sampling methods.

Spatial omics technologies enable a deeper understanding of cellular 
organizations and interactions within a tissue of interest. These assays can 
identify specific compartments or regions in a tissue with differential 
transcript or protein abundance, delineate their interactions, and complement 
other methods in defining cellular phenotypes. A variety of spatial 
methodologies are being developed and commercialized; however, these techniques 
differ in spatial resolution, multiplexing capability, scale/throughput, and 
coverage. Here, we review the current and prospective landscape of single cell 
to subcellular resolution spatial omics technologies and analysis tools to 
provide a comprehensive picture for both research and clinical applications.

During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two 
different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their 
colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further 
characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification 
of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods 
combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence 
analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB and 
TEF1), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic 
taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts 
belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T, isolated from 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the 
Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically 
and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast 
strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T, isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous 
and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium (Cystobasidiales, 
Cystobasidiomycetes) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose 
two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. 
(FJI-L2-BK-P3T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. 
(FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed 
that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and 
WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the 
two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration 
and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly 
related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. 
Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and 
compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine 
yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting 
and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve 
microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.

BACKGROUND: The Inspiration4 (I4) mission, the first all-civilian orbital flight 
mission, investigated the physiological effects of short-duration spaceflight 
through a multi-omic approach. Despite advances, there remains much to learn 
about human adaptation to spaceflight's unique challenges, including 
microgravity, immune system perturbations, and radiation exposure.
METHODS: To provide a detailed genetics analysis of the mission, we collected 
dried blood spots pre-, during, and post-flight for DNA extraction. Telomere 
length was measured by quantitative PCR, while whole genome and cfDNA sequencing 
provided insight into genomic stability and immune adaptations. A robust 
bioinformatic pipeline was used for data analysis, including variant calling to 
assess mutational burden.
RESULT: Telomere elongation occurred during spaceflight and shortened after 
return to Earth. Cell-free DNA analysis revealed increased immune cell 
signatures post-flight. No significant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate 
potential (CHIP) or whole-genome instability was observed. The long-term gene 
expression changes across immune cells suggested cellular adaptations to the 
space environment persisting months post-flight.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide valuable insights into the physiological 
consequences of short-duration spaceflight, with telomere dynamics and immune 
cell gene expression adapting to spaceflight and persisting after return to 
Earth. CHIP sequencing data will serve as a reference point for studying the 
early development of CHIP in astronauts, an understudied phenomenon as previous 
studies have focused on career astronauts. This study will serve as a reference 
point for future commercial and non-commercial spaceflight, low Earth orbit 
(LEO) missions, and deep-space exploration.

The increasing accessibility of commercial and private space travel necessitates 
a profound understanding of its impact on human health. The NASA Open Science 
Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological 
studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive 
data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical 
assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological 
responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging 
the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven 
data standards established by NASA's OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower 
artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, 
guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article 
presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including 
programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a 
precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, 
propelling research in the burgeoning field of commercial space travel's impact 
on human physiology.

Human spaceflight has historically been managed by government agencies, such 
as in the NASA Twins Study1, but new commercial spaceflight opportunities have 
opened spaceflight to a broader population. In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 
mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included 
the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental 
technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune 
profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, 
multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings 
from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological 
and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, 
and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term 
spaceflight2, but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) 
after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data 
suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and 
moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation 
to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and 
cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an 
open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts3, which can inform

Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini 
essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a 
previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes 
to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination 
in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent 
Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA 
in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, 
high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to 
astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in 
vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while 
simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric 
double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized 
TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric 
DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of 
TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA's role in facilitating 
recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications 
for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those 
associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, 
environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient 
ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic 
strategy against ALT-positive tumors.

Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and 
cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To 
investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted 
skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) 
flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, 
single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed 
spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 
skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer 
dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of 
genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These 
spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including 
altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell 
migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue 
compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin 
swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and 
timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of 
astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response 
countermeasures.

Maintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and 
potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts 
during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to 
limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study 
to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit 
for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics 
alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, 
multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, 
during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations 
were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites 
mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral 
microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, 
Fusobacteriota), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, 
microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin-antitoxin systems and 
stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. In total, this study 
reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts 
experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated 
changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, 
spacecraft design and space habitat planning.

It is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse 
set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes 
the activation of genes associated with blood homoeostasis and erythropoiesis, 
with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. 
Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it 
has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and 
protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we 
examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a 
unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA 
Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our findings 
reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the 
distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study 
sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the 
space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications 
of space omics research.

Spaceflight induces an immune response in astronauts. To better characterize 
this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), 
biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. 
We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle 
homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we 
identified a ""spaceflight signature"" of gene expression characterized by 
enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 
pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, 
including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 
NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed 
an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term 
suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with 
microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune 
disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to 
preserve astronaut health.

Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms 
are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated 
microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated 
states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis 
by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the 
Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and 
spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity 
alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, 
interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., 
Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and 
sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and 
impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify 
numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and 
demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. 
These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide 
opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.

Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts 
and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming 
increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space1-6. Yet current 
frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in 
precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of 
space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics 
and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, 
cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, 
including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 
crew10-12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold 
increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples 
available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes 
extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, 
epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, 
which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine 
shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as 
mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific 
mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to 
accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk 
mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and 
exploration-class missions.

As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures 
of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By 
profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles 
(EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated ""spaceflight secretome 
profiles,"" which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative 
stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant 
proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the 
majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these 
proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than 
erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched 
protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein 
changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in 
PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration 
spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight 
biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development.

Future multi-year crewed planetary missions will motivate advances in aerospace 
nutrition and telehealth. On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to 
spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel 
Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for 
space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, 
high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight 
healthcare. Alongside the scientific potential, we consider the complex ethical, 
cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, 
and how philosophical frameworks may benefit from international perspectives.

    Res Sq. 2023 Feb 10:rs.3.rs-2367727. doi: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2367727/v1.

BACKGROUND: Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the 
hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health 
risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of 
skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood.
METHODS: To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing 
NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic 
datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and 
human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA 
astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and 
skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4.
RESULTS: Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and 
mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health 
risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to 
determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While 
we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes 
associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also 
highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via 
post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.
CONCLUSION: Our findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures 
for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage.

Plain Language Summary: Spaceflight is a hostile environment which can lead to 
health problems in astronauts, including in the skin. It is not currently well 
understood why these skin problems occur. Here, we analyzed data from the skin 
of space flown mice and astronauts to try and identify possible explanations for 
these skin problems. It appears that changes in the activation of genes related 
to damage to DNA, skin barrier health, and mitochondria (the energy-producing 
parts of cells) may play a role in these skin problems. Further research will be 
needed to confirm exactly how these changes influence skin health, which could 
lead to solutions for preventing and managing such issues in astronauts.

Missions into Deep Space are planned this decade. Yet the health consequences of 
exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long 
missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely 
unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, 
epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, 
endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, 
tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 
spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 
simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) 
renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts' increased 
risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely 
a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results 
in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule 
density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip 
dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.

Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular 
level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend 
molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and 
humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling 
in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we 
observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant 
hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, 
metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, 
specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, 
spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. 
Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, 
estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly 
suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive 
endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful 
interplanetary species.

Common and rare alleles are now being annotated across millions of human 
genomes, and omics technologies are increasingly being used to develop health 
and treatment recommendations. However, these alleles have not yet been 
systematically characterized relative to aerospace medicine. Here, we review 
published alleles naturally found in human cohorts that have a likely protective 
effect, which is linked to decreased cancer risk and improved bone, muscular, 
and cardiovascular health. Although some technical and ethical challenges 
remain, research into these protective mechanisms could translate into improved 
nutrition, exercise, and health recommendations for crew members during deep 
space missions.

Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food 
for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies 
for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce 
has confirmed that the ""space production"" of lettuce is not inferior to that on 
Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the 
quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our 
work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space 
without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether 
this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch 
composition. The objects of the study were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) kernels 
of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space 
conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), 
and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under 
terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have 
significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width 
of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly 
large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial 
conditions-0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry 
will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between 
the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even 
(coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 
6-12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch 
granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in 
kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch 
granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It 
can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly 
higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5-8% higher than 
on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was 
significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new 
method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in 
early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the 
kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer 
scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.

The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts 
in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space 
experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., 
reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space 
conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv 'Outredgeous,' plants were 
grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) 
and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and 
harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which 
several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground 
controls were grown simultaneously with a 24-72 h delay using ISS environmental 
data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for 
bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from 
the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next 
Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic 
structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, 
as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance 
Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences 
in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 - 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while 
screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and 
fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation 
in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being 
higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only 
difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third 
experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf 
tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn 
content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC 
levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, 
edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts' diet, and provide baseline 
data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.

Polyamines, including cadaverine, are organic cations that affect numerous 
biological processes including transcription, translation, cell signalling, and 
ion channel activity. They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses 
in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a 
quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors 
that contribute to this response. Here it is shown that Arabidopsis thaliana 
accessions have varying root length responses to exogenous cadaverine: Cape 
Verde Islands (Cvi) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas 
Landsberg erecta (Ler) was one of the most sensitive. Recombinant inbred lines, 
near isogenic lines, and a microarray were used to show that variation in 
ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1) is at least partially responsible for this 
difference. OCT1 expression was higher in Cvi than in Ler, and oct1 mutants were 
more sensitive to cadaverine than wild-type plants. In oct1 mutants transformed 
with an ectopic copy of OCT1 originating from either Cvi or Ler, the expression 
level of the transgene, not its accession, correlated with the cadaverine 
response. These results suggest that decreased OCT1 expression confers 
cadaverine sensitivity in some accessions.

We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D 
(2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano 
phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric 
populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2-2 μm), which included 
prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich 
picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and 
bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based 
approach and a single 7-day exposure. Assays were performed on two different 
microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting 
turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 μgL-1, turbidity = 1 NTU) and 
organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 μgL-1, turbidity = 9 NTU). For each 
system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven 
concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 
0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L-1. The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to 
be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living 
(live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower 
concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and 
organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness 
and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 
2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and 
Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between 
water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP 
fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in 
PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in 
competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence 
of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological 
studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based 
formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to 
real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.

Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires 
tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that 
displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We 
identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 
(EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant 
phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE 
RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen 
species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar 
localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and 
ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling 
module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root 
tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that 
mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for 
antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously 
unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control 
of plant gravitropism.

Cadaverine, a polyamine, has been linked to modification of root growth 
architecture and response to environmental stresses in plants. However, the 
molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth by cadaverine are 
largely unexplored. Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a 
mutation, cadaverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3), which resulted in increased 
root-growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not other polyamines. This mutation 
affects the BIO3-BIO1 biotin biosynthesis gene. Exogenous supply of biotin and a 
pathway intermediate downstream of BIO1, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed 
this cadaverine sensitivity phenotype. An in vitro enzyme assay showed 
cadaverine inhibits the BIO3-BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine-treated 
seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 
of the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty acid 
biosynthesis, resulting in decreased accumulation of triacylglycerides. Taken 
together, these results revealed an unexpected role of cadaverine in the 
regulation of biotin biosynthesis, which leads to modulation of primary root 
growth of plants.

Clinostats are instruments that continuously rotate biological specimens along 
an axis, thereby averaging their orientation relative to gravity over time. Our 
previous experiments indicated that low-speed clinorotation may itself trigger 
directional root tip curvature. In this project, we have investigated the root 
curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and 
Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed 
clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by 
gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the 
angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. 
Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception (pgm) or gravity signal 
transduction (arg1, toc132) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response 
to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation 
triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral 
membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of 
auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for 
gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. 
Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different 
abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical 
clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association 
studies to further investigate this process.

Control of biofilms requires rapid methods to identify compounds effective 
against them and to isolate resistance-compromised mutants for identifying genes 
involved in enhanced biofilm resistance. While rapid screening methods for 
microtiter plate well (""static"") biofilms are available, there are no methods 
for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (""flow biofilms""). Since the 
latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a 
high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a 
new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed 
pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. 
This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a 
broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides 
compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein 
(GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of 
fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of 
biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed 
with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of 
fluorescence microscope image analysis. Using BioFlux and the plate reader, we 
were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the 
viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms.

Stationary-phase bacteria are important in disease. The σ(s)-regulated general 
stress response helps them become resistant to disinfectants, but the role of 
σ(s) in bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated. Loss of σ(s) 
rendered stationary-phase Escherichia coli more sensitive to the bactericidal 
antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a 
weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the psfiA genetic reporter, 
3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm 
generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. HPF measurements can 
be distorted by cell elongation, but Gm did not affect stationary-phase cell 
dimensions. Coadministration of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) 
decreased drug lethality particularly in the mutant, as did Gm treatment under 
anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Greater oxidative stress, due 
to insufficient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron 
leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; 
infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case also in 
vivo. Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, 
SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and 
TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater 
oxidative stress and killing by Gm. Thus, besides its established mode of 
action, Gm also kills stationary-phase bacteria by generating oxidative stress, 
and targeting the antioxidant defense of E. coli can enhance its efficacy. 
Relevant aspects of the current controversy on the role of ROS in killing by 
bactericidal drugs of exponential-phase bacteria, which represent a different 
physiological state, are discussed.

Mammalian cells employ an array of biological mechanisms to detect and respond 
to mechanical loading in their environment. One such mechanism is the formation 
of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell 
membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. Repair of PMD through an orchestrated 
activity of molecular machinery is critical for cell survival, and the rate of 
PMD repair can affect downstream cellular signaling. PMD have been observed to 
influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, 
aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and 
skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including 
osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore 
positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate 
organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the 
gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the 
skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD 
formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular 
emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling 
to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology. The 
implications of PMD-related mechanisms for disease and potential therapeutic 
applications are also explored.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine if the morphology and 
biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and 
the spaceflight environment.
DESIGN: Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space 
Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and 
from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined 
using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic 
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent 
in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as 
assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 
13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding 
protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor 
and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen 
after 30 d in space.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein 
expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals 
and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show 
that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva 
contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, 
therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular 
for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.

The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual 
glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery [Space 
Transportation System (STS)-131] and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in 
mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual 
glands of ground (control) and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed 
autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The 
expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of 
STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared with ground (control) 
mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, expression of mucin 
(MUC-19) in acinar cells and expression of the type II regulatory subunit of 
protein kinase A (PKA-RII) in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight 
mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell 
and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and 
nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response 
of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, 
cell types, and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, 
including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression. Determining 
changes in salivary proteins may lead to development of non-invasive methods to 
assess the physiological status of astronauts.

Introduction: Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from 
community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space 
radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may 
cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic 
and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is 
secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and 
plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The 
balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the 
submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological 
stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary 
secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in 
behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms 
underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. 
Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g) changes 
mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial 
gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, 
we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth 
gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to 
Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days after 
landing. Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the 
salivary amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which 
regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the 
exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small 
G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar 
gravity. Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary 
amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8. Our study 
highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in 
salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.

Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic 
radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space 
radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in 
astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several 
changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent 
herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or 
from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. 
Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to 
infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host 
without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses 
in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not 
well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 
137Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 
MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of 
reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 
0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, 
lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly 
higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with 
the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally 
tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata 
cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time 
for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that 
reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of 
radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines 
produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than 
protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, 
though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later 
reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the 
common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in 
radiobiology for other end points.

BACKGROUND: Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on 
how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these 
changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand 
this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes 
simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts 
pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight.
RESULTS: Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 
8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during 
spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were 
Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria 
which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella, Megasphera, and 
Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected 
pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already 
had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. 
Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive 
correlation with Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Abiotrophia and a 
negative correlation between Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. There 
was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV 
viral titers.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome 
changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for 
viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms 
that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a 
serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation 
strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space 
missions. Video abstract.

Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell 
divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel 
the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast 
to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-ATPases. 
The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root 
development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. 
However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along 
the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for 
visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis 
thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not 
primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, the distinct 
domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin 
response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin 
co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin 
response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.

Measurements of telomere length in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), a rare 
cell population within muscles, provide insights into cellular dysfunction in 
diseased conditions. Here, we describe a protocol (cryosection muscle 
quantitative fluorescent in situhybridization) using skeletal muscle 
cryosections for assessments of telomere length in MuSCs, in their native 
environment. Using a free software, telomere length measurements are assessed on 
a single-cell level. We also provide methodology to perform data analyses in 
several ways. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, 
please refer to Tichy et al. (2021).

During the repeated cycles of damage and repair in many muscle disorders, 
including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the muscle stem cell (MuSC) pool 
becomes less efficient at responding to and repairing damage. The underlying 
mechanism of such stem cell dysfunction is not fully known. Here, we demonstrate 
that the distinct early telomere shortening of diseased MuSCs in both mice and 
young DMD patients is associated with aberrant NF-κB activation. We find that 
prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened 
telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects. 
Our studies provide evidence of a role for NF-κB in regulating 
stem-cell-specific telomere length, independently of cell replication, and could 
be a congruent mechanism that is applicable to additional tissues and/or 
diseases characterized by systemic chronic inflammation.

Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential for tissue homeostasis and regeneration, 
but the potential contribution of MuSC morphology to in vivo function remains 
unknown. Here, we demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically 
heterogeneous and exhibit different patterns of cellular protrusions. We 
classified quiescent MuSCs into three functionally distinct stem cell states: 
responsive, intermediate, and sensory. We demonstrate that the shift between 
different stem cell states promotes regeneration and is regulated by the sensing 
protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 is sufficient to prime 
MuSCs toward more responsive cells. Piezo1 deletion in MuSCs shifts the 
distribution toward less responsive cells, mimicking the disease phenotype we 
find in dystrophic muscles. We further demonstrate that Piezo1 reactivation 
ameliorates the MuSC morphological and regenerative defects of dystrophic 
muscles. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of how stem cells 
respond to injury and identify Piezo1 as a key regulator for adjusting stem cell 
states essential for regeneration.

Astronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and 
microgravity. Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which 
shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight 
recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of 
muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of 
astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in 
grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb 
unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present 
in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident 
endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following 
hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to 
baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle 
acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, 
and upon their return to Earth.

Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas 
exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) has a 
central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second 
messengers, which include reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS accumulation must 
be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging 
levels within the cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that have been 
implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has 
been debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, but 
not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a flavonol-specific dye. The 
expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE, a gene 
encoding a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, 
suggests guard cell-specific flavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were 
detected using a fluorescent ROS sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4-2, 
which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore synthesizes no 
flavonol antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid 
ABA-induced closure than the wild type, suggesting that flavonols may dampen the 
ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closing. The levels of flavonols 
are positively regulated in guard cells by ethylene treatment in the wild type, 
but not in the ethylene-insensitive2-5 mutant. In addition, in both 
ethylene-overproducing1 and ethylene-treated wild-type plants, elevated 
flavonols lead to decreasing ROS and slower ABA-mediated stomatal closure. These 
results are consistent with flavonols suppressing ROS accumulation and 
decreasing the rate of ABA-dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene-induced 
increases in guard cell flavonols modulating these responses.

Angiosperm trees reorient their woody stems by asymmetrically producing a 
specialized xylem tissue, tension wood, which exerts a strong contractile force 
resulting in negative gravitropism of the stem. Here, we show, in Populus trees, 
that initial gravity perception and response occurs in specialized cells through 
sedimentation of starch-filled amyloplasts and relocalization of the auxin 
transport protein, PIN3. Gibberellic acid treatment stimulates the rate of 
tension wood formation and gravibending and enhances tissue-specific expression 
of an auxin-responsive reporter. Gravibending, maturation of contractile fibers, 
and gibberellic acid (GA) stimulation of tension wood formation are all 
sensitive to transcript levels of the Class I KNOX homeodomain transcription 
factor-encoding gene ARBORKNOX2 (ARK2). We generated genome-wide transcriptomes 
for trees in which gene expression was perturbed by gravistimulation, GA 
treatment, and modulation of ARK2 expression. These data were employed in 
computational analyses to model the transcriptional networks underlying wood 
formation, including identification and dissection of gene coexpression modules 
associated with wood phenotypes, GA response, and ARK2 binding to genes within 
modules. We propose a model for gravitropism in the woody stem in which the 
peripheral location of PIN3-expressing cells relative to the cambium results in 
auxin transport toward the cambium in the top of the stem, triggering tension 
wood formation, while transport away from the cambium in the bottom of the stem 
triggers opposite wood formation.

To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants 
alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions 
presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis 
is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma 
membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex 
contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site 
for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for 
all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during 
polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role 
in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane 
recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor 
of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a 
plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we 
examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis 
seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified 
our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root 
epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly 
reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate 
cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed 
that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall 
biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and 
nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial 
distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the 
plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of 
plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth.

Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport 
proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking 
machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by 
genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants 
complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive 
allele of Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1 (stomatal cytokinesis defective1) that 
encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root 
initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic 
reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of 
the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, 
but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. In scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN1- and 
PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 
25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in 
endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not 
detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The 
endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 exhibited FM4-64 
signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent 
with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments 
illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene 
encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the 
plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that 
altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in 
gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the 
restrictive temperature.

Microgravity is known to affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell and 
nuclear morphology and to elicit differential expression of genes associated 
with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions and the extracellular matrix. Although 
the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of 
Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of 
proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be defined. In our study, 
we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to 
investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the 
simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential 
gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a 
LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of 
exposure to simulated microgravity. These LINC-dependent genes likely represent 
elements normally regulated by the mechanical forces imposed by gravity on 
Earth.

The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface 
environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of 
that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because 
most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are 
considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six 
bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern 
Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low 
pressure (7 mbar), and a CO(2)-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA 
analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus 
Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. 
viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six 
permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. 
alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. 
maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable 
of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the 
low-pressure extreme at which life can function.

Studies of how microorganisms respond to pressure have been limited mostly to 
the extreme high pressures of the deep sea (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, 
despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures 
below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To 
study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus 
subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly 
inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 
km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to 
several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). 
Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the 
SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon. Upregulation of the GSR by 
LP was confirmed by monitoring the expression of the SigB-dependent ctc-lacZ 
reporter fusion. Measuring transcriptome changes resulting from exposure of 
bacterial cells to LP reveals insights into cellular processes that may respond 
to LP exposure.

The roles of various core components, including α/β/γ-type small acid-soluble 
spore proteins (SASP), dipicolinic acid (DPA), core water content, and DNA 
repair by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases or nonhomologous end joining 
(NHEJ), in Bacillus subtilis spore resistance to different types of ionizing 
radiation including X rays, protons, and high-energy charged iron ions have been 
studied. Spores deficient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the 
oxidative stress response, or protection by major α/β-type SASP, DPA, and 
decreased core water content were significantly more sensitive to ionizing 
radiation than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged 
iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases appears to be the most 
important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen 
radical detoxification via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX 
catalase activity plays only a very minor role. Synergistic radioprotective 
effects of α/β-type but not γ-type SASP were also identified, indicating that 
α/β-type SASP's binding to spore DNA is important in preventing DNA damage due 
to reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation.

Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are persistent inhabitants of human 
spaceflight habitats and represent potential opportunistic pathogens. The effect 
of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and the frequency of 
mutations to antibiotic resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus 
epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was investigated. Six cultures of the test organism 
were cultivated in biological research in canisters-Petri dish fixation units 
for 122 h on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the 
SpaceX-3 resupply mission. Asynchronous ground controls (GCs) consisted of 
identical sets of cultures cultivated for 122 h in the ISS Environmental 
Simulator at Kennedy Space Center. S. epidermidis exhibited significantly lower 
viable counts but significantly higher frequencies of mutation to rifampicin 
(Rif) resistance in space vs. GC cultures. The spectrum of mutations in the rpoB 
gene leading to Rif(R) was altered in S. epidermidis isolates cultivated in the 
ISS compared to GCs. The results suggest that the human spaceflight environment 
induces unique physiologic stresses on growing bacterial cells leading to 
changes in mutagenic potential.

The ongoing rise in global temperatures poses significant challenges to 
ecosystems, particularly impacting bacterial communities that are central to 
biogeochemical cycles. The resilience of wild mesophilic bacteria to temperature 
increases of 2-4 °C remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted 
experimental evolution on six wild Bacillus strains from two lineages (Bacillus 
cereus and Bacillus subtilis) to examine their thermal adaptation strategies. We 
exposed the bacteria to gradually increasing temperatures to assess their 
thermal plasticity, focusing on the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation. 
While B. subtilis lineages improved growth at highly critical temperatures, only 
one increased its thermal niche to 4 °C above their natural range. This finding 
is concerning given climate change projections. B. cereus strains exhibited 
higher mutation rates but were not able to grow at increasing temperatures, 
while B. subtilis required fewer genetic changes to increase heat tolerance, 
indicating distinct adaptive strategies. We observed convergent evolution in 
five evolved lines, with mutations in genes involved in c-di-AMP synthesis, 
which is crucial for potassium transport, implicating this chemical messenger 
for the first time in heat tolerance. These insights highlight the vulnerability 
of bacteria to climate change and underscore the importance of genetic 
background in shaping thermal adaptation.

Past results have suggested that bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is altered 
during space flight. To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were 
cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in 
space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) 
samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The 
susceptibility of FL and GC samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and 
growth-inhibitory compounds using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. 
Only 9 compounds were identified by PM screening as exhibiting significant 
differences (P < 0.05, Student's t test) in FL versus GC samples: 
6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, manganese(II) 
chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and 
trifluoperazine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay 
did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory 
concentrations (IC50s) between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the 
susceptibility of B. subtilis cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth 
inhibitors is not dramatically altered by space flight.IMPORTANCE This study 
addresses a major concern of mission planners for human space flight, that 
bacteria accompanying astronauts on long-duration missions might develop a 
higher level of resistance to antibiotics due to exposure to the space flight 
environment. The results of this study do not support that notion.

The effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceflight environment on 
growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance 
(RifR) was investigated. B. subtilis cells were cultivated in Biological 
Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) on two separate 
missions to the International Space Station (ISS), dubbed BRIC-18 and BRIC-21, 
with matching asynchronous ground controls. No statistically significant 
difference in either growth or in the frequency of mutation to RifR was found in 
either experiment. However, nucleotide sequencing of the RifR regions of the 
rpoB gene from RifR mutants revealed dramatic differences in the spectrum of 
mutations between flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples, including two 
newly discovered rpoB alleles in the FL samples (Q137R and L489S). The results 
strengthen the idea that exposure to the human spaceflight environment causes 
unique stresses on bacteria, leading to alterations in their mutagenic 
potential.

Our understanding of the mechanisms of microgravity perception and response in 
prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) lag behind those which have been elucidated 
in eukaryotic organisms. In this hypothesis paper, we: (i) review how eukaryotic 
cells sense and respond to microgravity using various pathways responsive to 
unloading of mechanical stress; (ii) we observe that prokaryotic cells possess 
many structures analogous to mechanosensitive structures in eukaryotes; (iii) we 
review current evidence indicating that prokaryotes also possess active 
mechanosensing and mechanotransduction mechanisms; and (iv) we propose a 
complete mechanotransduction model including mechanisms by which mechanical 
signals may be transduced to the gene expression apparatus through alterations 
in bacterial nucleoid architecture, DNA supercoiling, and epigenetic pathways.

RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that 
contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. In 
Bacillus subtilis, mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNAP 
have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, 
utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and 
production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in 
rpoB leading to rifampin resistance (Rifr) can change dramatically depending 
upon the environment to which B. subtilis cells or spores are exposed. RifrrpoB 
mutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced 
fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited 
collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural 
environments typically inhabited by B. subtilis. Using a novel deep-sequencing 
approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and 
pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of 
specific rpoB alleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they 
are determined. IMPORTANCE Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing 
threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to 
antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence 
indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat 
mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an 
appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, 
we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of 
multiple rifampin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis in rich LB medium and 
an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of 
rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has 
important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial 
resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.

The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers 
asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System 
(SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. 
However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal 
disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains 
were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not 
required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in 
vivo-like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic 
model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized 
Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS 
was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella 
strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS 
knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype 
levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, 
whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed 
Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not 
preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal 
aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. 
Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial 
replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs 
are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of 
human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial 
growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility 
of these models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in differentiating epithelial 
tissues. Cancers caused by high-risk types (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) typically 
occur at oropharyngeal and anogenital anatomical sites. The HPV life cycle is 
differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology that is able to 
recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report 
two distinct and complementary methods for growing differentiating epithelial 
tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in 
vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells 
on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living 
fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, 
differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second 
approach uses a rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear 
microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use 
collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self-assemble into 3D 
cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived 
from HPV-positive and HPV-negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of 
the article introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue 
models. We describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully 
culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells. These tissues have been used 
for microscopic visualization, scanning electron microscopy, and large 
omics-based studies to gain insights into epithelial biology, the HPV life 
cycle, and host-pathogen interactions. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic

The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of 
fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in 
dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or 
transitions to cause disease. By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to 
create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was 
evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and 
virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a 
novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in 
extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured 
cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including 
decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, 
and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray 
profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic 
expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which 
parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is 
the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive 
organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among 
structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus 
responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization 
phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight 
into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization 
during the initial host-pathogen interaction.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are 
differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that 
increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. In this study, we show 
that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon, ydcI or STM1625, 
encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in 
a range of gram-negative bacterial genera. Gene expression analysis shows that 
ydcI is expressed in different bacterial genera and is involved in its 
autoregulation in S. Typhimurium. We demonstrate that purified YdcI protein 
specifically binds a DNA probe consisting of its own promoter sequence. We 
constructed an S. Typhimurium ΔydcI mutant strain and show that this strain is 
more sensitive to both organic and inorganic acid stress than is an isogenic WT 
strain, and this defect is complemented in trans. Moreover, our data indicate 
that ydcI is part of the rpoS regulon related to stress resistance. The S. 
Typhimurium ΔydcI mutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as 
the WT strain, but a strain in which ydcI expression is induced invaded cells at 
a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. In addition, induction of ydcI 
expression in S. Typhimurium resulted in the formation of a biofilm in 
stationary-phase cultures. These data indicate the ydcI gene encodes a conserved 
DNA binding protein involved with aspects of prokaryotic biology related to 
stress resistance and possibly virulence.

Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline 
provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized 
and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental 
changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are 
few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, 
abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess 
changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from 
abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark 
Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, to discover potential 
causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and 
population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population 
and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969-2009, and 
the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. 
Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental 
organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with 
only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi. Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas 
hydrophila, a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens, Gordonai 
terrae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus 
pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. 
stutzeri, and P. alcaligenes. Fungal isolates included species in the genera 
Penicillium, Acremonium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium, Streptomycetes, and 
the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known 
to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds 
suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi 
may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid 
salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in 
C. a. bishopi may have many contributing factors including disease and habitat 
degradation. Results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian 
population declines.

Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment 
and prevention of infectious diseases during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, 
this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between 
low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection 
process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the 
spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space 
habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential 
regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional 
regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first 
spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. 
aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB 
lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), which is involved in 
rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. 
aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in 
microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) 
bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, 
similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While 
RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic 
metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an 
anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether 
the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to 
spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa 
remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk 
assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general 
public.

Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including avian pathogenic E. coli 
(APEC), pose a considerable threat to both human and animal health, with illness 
causing substantial economic loss. APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing 
three large plasmids [pChi7122-1 (IncFIB/FIIA-FIC), pChi7122-2 (IncFII), and 
pChi7122-3 (IncI(2))]; and a small plasmid pChi7122-4 (ColE2-like), has been 
used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC 
pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized 
the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; 
however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we 
present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that 
pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and a 
putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. 
New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122-2 that 
is not present in other E. coli strains but is found in Salmonella serovars and 
is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the 
APEC χ7122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually 
or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm 
formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction of E. coli strains with 
3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we show that the 
nature and combinations of plasmids, as well as the background of the host 
strains, have an effect on these phenomena. Our data reveal new insights into 
the role of extra-chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in 
their phenotypes.

Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. An in vitro 
model for NoV replication remains elusive, making study of the virus difficult. 
A previous study, which used a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal model derived from 
INT-407 cells reported NoV replication and extensive cytopathic effects (CPE). 
Using the same 3-D model, but with highly purified Norwalk virus (NV), we 
attempted to replicate this study. Our results showed no evidence of NV 
replication by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of 
viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis of the 
3-D cultures also showed no detectable presence of histo-blood group antigens 
that participate in NV binding and host tropism. To determine the potential 
cause of CPE observed in the previous study, we exposed 3-D cultures to 
lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent with contaminated stool samples and 
observed morphologic features similar to CPE. We conclude that the 3-D INT-407 
model does not support NV replication.

Low fluid shear force, including that encountered in microgravity models, 
induces bacterial responses, but the range of bacteria capable of responding to 
this signal remains poorly characterized. We systematically analyzed a range of 
Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae for conservation of the low-shear modeled 
microgravity (LSMMG) response using phenotypic assays, qPCR, and targeted 
mutations. Our results indicate LSMMG response conservation across 
Enterobacteriacae with potential variance in up- or down-regulation of a given 
response depending on genus. Based on the data, we analyzed the role of the trp 
operon genes and the TrpR regulator in the LSMMG response using targeted 
mutations in these genes in S. Typhimurium and E. coli. We found no alteration 
of the LSMMG response compared to WT in these mutant strains under the 
conditions tested here. To our knowledge, this study is first-of-kind for 
Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia, presents novel data for Escherichia, 
and provides the first analysis of trp genes in LSMMG responses. This impacts 
our understanding of how LSMMG affects bacteria and our ability to modify 
bacteria with this condition in the future.

Why is a healthy person protected from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, while 
individuals with cystic fibrosis or damaged epithelium are particularly 
susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen? To address this question, it is 
essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host 
microenvironment and P. aeruginosa. Therefore, using model systems that 
represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows 
recreating in vivo host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant 
manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as 
apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix 
proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and 
other physicochemical factors affect P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and are thus 
important to mimic in vitro. We highlight in vitro cell and tissue culture model 
systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to 
study the infectious disease process of P. aeruginosa, mainly focusing on lung 
models, and their respective advantages and limitations. Continued improvements 
of in vitro models based on our expanding knowledge of host microenvironmental 
factors that participate in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis will help advance 
fundamental understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and increase the 
translational potential of research findings from bench to the patient's 
bedside.

To address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19), this review describes experimental, clinical and 
epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the 
weeks before infection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple 
ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 
mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. 
Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause 
multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain 
body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by 
infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) 
signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na+/K+-ATPase, 
chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may 
conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, 
lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, 
increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or 
reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the 
airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding 
strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to 
increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 
testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. 
Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 
mortality. Attention to hydration holds potential to reduce COVID-19 mortality 
and disparities via at least 5 pathways simultaneously.

Strategies are needed to improve repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds 
with stromal and functional epithelial cells. We demonstrate that decellularized 
mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, 
termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased 
apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to 
static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two 
relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells 
(MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in 
decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed 
multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses 
suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like 
cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the 
decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is 
promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could 
contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with 
subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.

Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated 
form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional 
monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reflect in vivo 
infections. To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional 
models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments 
encountered by Salmonella, we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional 
co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the 
NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon 
collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the 
three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal 
differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and 
bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural 
and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, 
apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, 
multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages. Phagocytic activity 
of macrophages was confirmed by uptake of inert, bacteria-sized beads. 
Contribution of macrophages to infection was assessed by colonization studies of 
Salmonella pathovars with different host adaptations and disease phenotypes 
(Typhimurium ST19 strain SL1344 and ST313 strain D23580; Typhi Ty2). ﻿﻿In 
addition, Salmonella were cultured aerobically or microaerobically, 
recapitulating environments encountered prior to and during intestinal 
infection, respectively﻿. All Salmonella strains exhibited decreased 
colonization in co-culture (HT-29-U937) relative to epithelial (HT-29) models, 
indicating antimicrobial function of macrophages. Interestingly, D23580 
exhibited enhanced replication/survival in both models following invasion. 
Pathovar-specific differences in colonization and intracellular co-localization 
patterns were observed. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a 
series of related three-dimensional models within a study to identify 
microenvironmental factors important for regulating infection.

Tissues and organs provide the structural and biochemical landscapes upon which 
microbial pathogens and commensals function to regulate health and disease. 
While flat two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have 
provided important insight into understanding host-pathogen interactions and 
infectious disease mechanisms, these reductionist models lack many essential 
features present in the native host microenvironment that are known to regulate 
infection, including three-dimensional (3-D) architecture, multicellular 
complexity, commensal microbiota, gas exchange and nutrient gradients, and 
physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, 
compression). A major challenge in tissue engineering for infectious disease 
research is recreating this dynamic 3-D microenvironment (biological, chemical, 
and physical/mechanical) to more accurately model the initiation and progression 
of host-pathogen interactions in the laboratory. Here we review selected 3-D 
models of human intestinal mucosa, which represent a major portal of entry for 
infectious pathogens and an important niche for commensal microbiota. We 
highlight seminal studies that have used these models to interrogate 
host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, and we present 
this literature in the appropriate historical context. Models discussed include 
3-D organotypic cultures engineered in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) 
bioreactor, extracellular matrix (ECM)-embedded/organoid models, and 
organ-on-a-chip (OAC) models. Collectively, these technologies provide a more 
physiologically relevant and predictive framework for investigating infectious 
disease mechanisms and antimicrobial therapies at the intersection of the host, 
microbe, and their local microenvironments.

Spaceflight uniquely alters the physiology of both human cells and microbial 
pathogens, stimulating cellular and molecular changes directly relevant to 
infectious disease. However, the influence of this environment on host-pathogen 
interactions remains poorly understood. Here we report our results from the 
STL-IMMUNE study flown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-131, which investigated 
multi-omic responses (transcriptomic, proteomic) of human intestinal epithelial 
cells to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium when both host and pathogen were 
simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. To our knowledge, this was the first 
in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells.

Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom 
in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote 
and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects 
of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related 
phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we 
report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with 
C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 
and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of 
PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased 
their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors 
EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We 
also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum 
of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned 
taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. 
Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced 
motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral 
effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that 
alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these 
phenotypes.

This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic 
characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida 
albicans, grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. 
albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 
452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the 
analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans-induced genes involved in cell 
aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and 
flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of 
spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground 
samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes 
involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated 
in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major 
facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and 
upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, 
downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. 
Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 
regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A 
potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, 
as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative 
stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. 
albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global 
change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no 
increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was 
observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an 
important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play 
during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear 
environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by 
pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could 
identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the 
general public.

This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and 
physiological adaptations of Candida albicans cultured in microgravity on the 
International Space Station across several payloads. C. albicans is a common 
opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial 
infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. 
Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the 
population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and 
the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated 
with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response 
to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this 
yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors 
were analyzed and compared herein. In general, C. albicans had a slightly 
shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared 
to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between 
bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and 
terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a 
colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in 
terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a 
ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an 
increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal 
agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when 
challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin. In 
aggregate, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of 
characteristics associated with virulence. In addition, and beyond the value of 
the specific responses of C. albicans to microgravity, this report includes an 
analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two 
spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and 
payload timelines.

With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify 
precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms 
exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis 
working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing 
short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The 
pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene 
quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed 
genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data 
submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab 
database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of 
this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability 
of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future 
spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from 
other databases with the data available in GeneLab.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics 
(SRT) have experienced rapid development in recent years. The findings of 
spaceflight-based scRNA-seq and SRT investigations are likely to improve our 
understanding of life in space and our comprehension of gene expression in 
various cell systems and tissue dynamics. However, compared to their Earth-based 
counterparts, gene expression experiments conducted in spaceflight have not 
experienced the same pace of development. Out of the hundreds of spaceflight 
gene expression datasets available, only a few used scRNA-seq and SRT. In this 
perspective piece, we explore the growing importance of scRNA-seq and SRT in 
space biology and discuss the challenges and considerations relevant to robust 
experimental design to enable growth of these methods in the field.

The advent of civilian spaceflight challenges scientists to precisely describe 
the effects of spaceflight on human physiology, particularly at the molecular 
and cellular level. Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can 
quantitatively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single 
molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA 
nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole 
blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven 
timepoints, spanning pre-flight, day of return, and post-flight recovery. We 
report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation, stress 
induction, and immune changes affected by spaceflight. We also present the first 
m6A methylation profiles for a human space mission, suggesting a significant 
spike in m6A levels immediately post-flight. These data and results represent 
the first longitudinal long-read RNA profiles and RNA modification maps for each 
gene for astronauts, improving our understanding of the human transcriptome's 
dynamic response to spaceflight.

The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the 
impact of spaceflight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were collected from 
four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during 
(Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 
days) spaceflight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection 
process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, 
urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and 
skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to obtain aliquots of 
serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central 
lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking. This paper 
provides an overview of the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights 
their processing procedures and long-term biobanking techniques, facilitating 
future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this study details a robust 
framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, and 
environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical 
Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space 
biology experiments.

The discovery of new drugs is often propelled by the increasing resistance of 
parasites to existing drugs and the availability of better technology platforms. 
The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of 
compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated 
behavioral pattern recognition. In most microfluidic devices, drug effects on 
small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) are quantified by an end-point, 
dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or 
stroke frequency). Here, we present a multi-parameter extraction method to 
characterize modes of paralysis in C. elegans over an extended time period. A 
microfluidic device with real-time imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four 
anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and 
methyridine). We quantified worm behavior with parameters such as curls per 
second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of 
active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC75 where 75% of the 
worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent concentrations, we 
observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed in drug 
environments. Our study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on small 
animal models with multiple parameters quantified at regular time points over an 
extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in 
chemical environments.

Environmental toxicants influence development, behavior, and ultimately 
survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an exceptionally 
powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to 
describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. 
Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of 
cyanide resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing 
enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by 
the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide 
resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 
hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which 
likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the 
expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited 
in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative 
resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic 
chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time 
imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by 
the chemical nature of the toxicant. The microfluidic assay produces a set of 
behavioral parameters with increased resolution that describe cyanide toxicity 
and resistance in C. elegans, and this is particularly useful in analyzing 
subtle phenotypes. These multiparameter analyses of C. elegans behavior hold 
great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical 
interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin 
toxicant resistance.

Growth performance and root transcriptome remodeling of Arabidopsis in response 
to Mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate.

BACKGROUND: Martian regolith (unconsolidated surface material) is a potential 
medium for plant growth in bioregenerative life support systems during manned 
missions on Mars. However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the 
regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly 
inhibitory to plant growth.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Disabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and 
AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not 
an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. Arabidopsis 
mrs2-10 and sel1-10 knockout lines do not mitigate the growth inhibiting impacts 
of high MgSO(4).7H(2)O concentrations observed with wildtype plants. A global 
approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to 
high MgSO(4).7H(2)O (magnesium sulfate) stress. The early Arabidopsis root 
transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was 
characterized in Col-0, and also between Col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1, which 
was confirmed to be relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO(4).7H(2)O in soil 
solution. Differentially expressed genes in Col-0 treated for 45 min. encode 
enzymes primarily involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, 
calcium-binding proteins, kinases, cell wall related proteins and membrane-based 
transporters. Over 200 genes encoding transporters were differentially expressed 
in Col-0 up to 180 min. of exposure, and one of the first down-regulated genes 
was CAX1. The importance of this early response in wildtype Arabidopsis is 
exemplified in the fact that only four transcripts were differentially expressed 
between Col-0 and cax1-1 at 180 min. after initiation of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results provide a solid basis for the 
understanding of the metabolic response of plants to elevated magnesium sulfate 
soils; it is the first transcriptome analysis of plants in this environment. The 
results foster the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by showing that 
cax1 mutants exhibit partial tolerance to magnesium sulfate, and by elucidating 
a small subset (500 vs. >10,000) of candidate genes for mutation or metabolic 
engineering that will enhance tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils.

The 14-3-3 proteins specifically bind a number of client proteins to influence 
important pathways, including flowering timing via the photosensory system. For 
instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions 
with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system 
were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants 
to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutant, 
14-3-3μ-1, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root 
length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 ν T-DNA insertion 
mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red 
light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root 
greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength 
and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth, 14-3-3μ-1 roots did not increase 
in greening as much as wild-type roots. This study reveals new developmental 
roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association 
with the photosensory system.

14-3-3 phosphoprotein interaction networks - does isoform diversity present 
functional interaction specification?

Department, University of Florida Gainesville, FL, USA.

The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins 
and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node 
through which a large number of important signals pass. Throughout their history 
of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein 
families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family 
members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, 
there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that 
the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over 
evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific 
expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question - does 
14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the 
biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on 
both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable 
observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 
isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional 
specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 
14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 
roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 
experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue 
to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.

BACKGROUND: During medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity 
can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of 
intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is 
necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known 
Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins 
(GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to 
regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study 
focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by 
microgravity.
METHODS: A hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the 
intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify 
these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA 
gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further 
analyzed.
RESULTS: We found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal 
injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological 
damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the 
levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored 
the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut 
microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of 
short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level 
of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid.
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological 
disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. 
The underlying mechanism may be related to the ""intestinal immune 
-microbiota-metabolic"" pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for 
the precise design and development of GTSs for space-health products.

Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including 
microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular 
levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives 
insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis' 
molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. 
Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the 
International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters - 
Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on 
Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. 
RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular 
fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic 
machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem 
core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the 
microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and 
proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of 
transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and 
mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, 
exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in 
spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE 
PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B 
(TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased 
expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell 
wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and 
proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic 
intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased 
metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the 
activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel 
insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the 
spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop 
production in Space.

The initial characterization of the Aspergillus niger isolate JSC-093350089, 
collected from U.S. segment surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS), 
is reported, along with a comparison to the extensively studied strain ATCC 
1015. Whole-genome sequencing of the ISS isolate enabled its phylogenetic 
placement within the A. niger/welwitschiae/lacticoffeatus clade and revealed 
that the genome of JSC-093350089 is within the observed genetic variance of 
other sequenced A. niger strains. The ISS isolate exhibited an increased rate of 
growth and pigment distribution compared to a terrestrial strain. Analysis of 
the isolate's proteome revealed significant differences in the molecular 
phenotype of JSC-093350089, including increased abundance of proteins involved 
in the A. niger starvation response, oxidative stress resistance, cell wall 
modulation, and nutrient acquisition. Together, these data reveal the existence 
of a distinct strain of A. niger on board the ISS and provide insight into the 
characteristics of melanized fungal species inhabiting spacecraft environments. 
IMPORTANCE A thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the 
various stimuli encountered during spaceflight presents many economic benefits 
and is imperative for the health of crew. As A. niger is a predominant ISS 
isolate frequently detected in built environments, studies of A. niger strains 
inhabiting closed systems may reveal information fundamental to the success of 
long-duration space missions. This investigation provides valuable insights into 
the adaptive mechanisms of fungi in extreme environments as well as 
countermeasures to eradicate unfavorable microbes. Further, it enhances 
understanding of host-microbe interactions in closed systems, which can help 
NASA's Human Research Program maintain a habitat healthy for crew during 
long-term manned space missions.

Plants have been recognized as key components of bioregenerative life support 
systems for space exploration, and many experiments have been carried out to 
evaluate their adaptability to spaceflight. Unfortunately, few of these 
experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops 
used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the 
ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew 
Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a 
customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground 
controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ's growth and 
morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were 
investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly 
and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground 
control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates 
between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. 
The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different 
transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the 
largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), 
followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared 
between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding 
wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs 
associated with the ""Oxidative Stress Response"" GO group were up-regulated in 
the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that 
Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to 
the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium 
oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a 
connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased 
expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In 
Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the ""Plant Hormonal 
Signaling"" and ""MAP Kinase Signaling"" KEGG pathways. Overall, these data 
indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity 
environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve 
oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, 
expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational 
modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to 
those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. However, 
organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ 
both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly 
evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their 
specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation 
strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: In spaceflight experiments, tissues for morphologic study 
are fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, while tissues for molecular study are fixed in 
RNAlater; thus, an experiment containing both study components requires multiple 
fixation strategies. The possibility of using RNAlater-fixed materials for 
standard SEM-based morphometric investigation was explored to expand the library 
of tissues available for analysis and maximize usage of samples returned from 
spaceflight, but these technologies have wide application to any situation where 
recovery of biological resources is limited. •
METHODS AND RESULTS: RNAlater-fixed samples were desalinated in distilled water, 
dehydrated through graded methanol, plunged into liquid ethane, and transferred 
to cryovials for freeze-substitution. Sample tissues were critical point dried, 
mounted, sputter-coated, and imaged. •
CONCLUSIONS: The protocol resulted in acceptable SEM images from RNAlater-fixed 
Arabidopsis thaliana tissue. The majority of the tissues remained intact, 
including general morphology and finer details such as root hairs and trichomes.

Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station 
has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or 
enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome 
of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant 
physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that 
alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling 
aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight 
adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required 
for that adaptation. Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain 
insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 
(Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study 
compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived 
from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient 
in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell 
lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic 
(CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines 
were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that 
were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. 
Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were 
identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground 
controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique 
genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with 
little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT 
cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in 
the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight. Key 
Words: ARG1-Spaceflight-Gene expression-Physiological adaptation-BRIC.

A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana 
(Arabidopsis) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene 
expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among 
Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation 
is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on 
orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of 
ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a 
previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5' 
flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly 
observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon 
wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an 
apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480, which are associated 
with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS 
production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests 
that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, 
a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and 
subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate 
that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in 
regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit 
suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.

Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) is part of the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) network, and 
plays an essential role beyond heat shock in environmental stress responses and 
cellular homeostatic control. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from 
wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding 
HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to 
ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel 
environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using 
a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between 
the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same 
genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, 
gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to 
WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each 
genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that 
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define 
the HSFA2 KO cells' physiological state irrespective of the environment, and 
likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding 
machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its 
universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the 
physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal 
perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered 
the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to 
adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2-dependent genes that are important to 
the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight. Collectively these data indicate 
a non-thermal role for the HSF network in spaceflight adaptation.

A comprehensive understanding of spaceflight factors involved in immune 
dysfunction and the evaluation of biomarkers to assess in-flight astronaut 
health are essential goals for NASA. An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered 
during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and 
astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), 
respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based 
models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall 
vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV 
simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles 
comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we 
found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of 
redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory 
neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the 
simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that 
have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, 
and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype 
HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses 
that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated 
microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential 
biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring.

Spaceflight missions can cause immune system dysfunction in astronauts with 
little understanding of immune outcomes in deep space. This study assessed 
immune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep spaceflight 
conditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station 
missions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb 
unloaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic 
cosmic rays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune profiling results 
revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, 
suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with 
clear consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence 
analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation. Furthermore, a 
large astronaut cohort showed elevated inflammation during low-Earth orbit 
missions, thereby supporting our simulated ground experiments in mice. Herein, 
circulating immune biomarkers are defined by distinct deep space irradiation 
types coupled to simulated microgravity and could be targets for future space 
health initiatives.

Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, 
hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation 
(LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and 
hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed. Collected 
blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole 
transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed 
negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system 
analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell 
differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks 
indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes 
(DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin 
organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, 
DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with 
inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated 
spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human 
blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming 
growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. 
Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 
1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from 
spaceflight is an unremitting process.

Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show 
transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic 
stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, 
similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional 
role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 - 
Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in 
spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International 
Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation 
profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 
(met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)] along with a wild-type Col-0 
control. Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation 
to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the 
overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 
plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner 
similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants 
compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in 
a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5. Many of 
the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were 
differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were 
representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes 
associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. 
However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented 
patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each 
other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe 
spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5. Conclusion: 
Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA 
methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase 
function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet 
met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. 
Disruption of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, 
together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.

The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds 
depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments 
using in-situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that 
the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar 
regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar 
regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. 
Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes 
indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and 
reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be 
useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. 
The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further 
elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith 
for life support within lunar stations.

Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system (CNS), and understanding 
neurological responses is important for future missions. We report CNS changes 
in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to spaceflight 
microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight 
centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg 
exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing 
defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. 
Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress and 
synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological 
changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count 
alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. 
Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg 
brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth 
conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially 
protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.

Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating 
short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for 
complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes 
(KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at 
certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample 
side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were 
activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq 
analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved 
consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots 
adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These 
responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple 
containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. 
While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time 
in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that 
transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this 
approach.

Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight 
and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters 
that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew 
health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte 
activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused 
on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of 
mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission 
STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell 
activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine 
production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, 
or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight 
and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations 
between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight 
splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4+CD25+ and 
CD8+CD25+ cells, lower percentage of CD11c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage 
of CD11c+MHC I+ populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes 
demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to 
decrease in CD4+ population but increased CD4+CD25+ cells compared to ground 
controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c+ population in 
splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, 
flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in 
CD11c+MHC I+, CD11c+MHC II+, and CD11c+CD86+ cells compared to ground controls. 
Production of IFN-γ was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated 
flight splenocytes. This study demonstrated that expression of surface molecules 
can be affected by conditions of spaceflight and impaired responsiveness 
persists under culture conditions in vitro.

High-energy particle radiation could have a considerable impact on health during 
space missions. This study evaluated C57BL/6 mice on Day 40 after total-body 
56Fe26+ irradiation at 0, 1, 2 and 3 gray (Gy). Radiation consistently increased 
thymus mass (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.005); spleen, liver and lung masses were 
similar among all groups. In the blood, there was no radiation effect on the 
white blood cell (WBC) count or major leukocyte types. However, the red blood 
cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and 
percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and 
spontaneous blastogenesis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared 
with unirradiated controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In contrast, splenic WBC, 
lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, %B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were 
all significantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of 
the irradiated groups compared with controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Although there 
were trends for minor, radiation-induced increases in %CD11b+ granulocytes in 
the spleen, cells double-labeled with adhesion markers (CD11b+CD54+, 
CD11b+CD62E+) were normal. Splenocyte spontaneous blastogenesis and that induced 
by mitogens (PHA, ConA, LPS) was equivalent to normal. In bone marrow, the 
percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers, Sca-1 and CD34/Sca-1, were low 
in one or more of the irradiated groups (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the 
data indicate that significant immunological abnormalities still exist more than 
a month after 56Fe irradiation and that there are differences dependent upon 
body compartment.

The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 
2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space 
Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the 
Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were 
maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to 
investigators as part of NASA's Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group 
characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the 
spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and 
transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic 
leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related 
activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both 
the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine 
levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic 
profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or 
psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of 
increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of 
peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS 
metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to 
fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the 
clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, 
we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in 
immune and metabolic function.

Increased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the 
space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 
13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative 
defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-'omic 
analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the 
Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed 
significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to 
glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative 
dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment 
of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with 
enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When 
taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 
2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic 
oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, 
induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial 
dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.

While many efforts have been made to pave the way toward human space 
colonization, little consideration has been given to the methods of protecting 
spacefarers against harsh cosmic and local radioactive environments and the high 
costs associated with protection from the deleterious physiological effects of 
exposure to high-Linear energy transfer (high-LET) radiation. Herein, we lay the 
foundations of a roadmap toward enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes 
of deep space colonization and exploration. We outline future research 
directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including 
upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible 
leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the 
translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective 
mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and 
methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. We 
conclude by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and 
longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is 
likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well.

There is evidence that spaceflight poses acute and late risks to the central 
nervous system. To explore possible mechanisms, the proteomic changes following 
spaceflight in mouse brain were characterized. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) 
was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission. Within 3⁻5 
h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression 
profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there 
were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray 
and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray 
matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, 
synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and 
metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment 
induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure 
and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain 
structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space 
missions.

Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from 
growing interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected 
by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous 
transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression 
after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term 
spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic 
changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space 
Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and 
three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our 
analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after 
spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to 
be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization 
were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular 
matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts 
occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a 
significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. 
Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by 
spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive 
response to long-term spaceflight.

The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that 
has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known 
about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater 
understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate 
the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital 
Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded 
controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu 
Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of 
attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with 
a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed 
hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the 
four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses 
were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress 
were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings 
enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to 
spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight 
at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate 
oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.

The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK) gene family is crucial to 
various molecular and cellular processes in plants. We identified 50 PERK genes 
in Brassica napus to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, 
and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly 
distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios 
revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited 
significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric 
points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses 
revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine 
kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis-element analysis predicted 
the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling 
showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting 
potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein-protein 
interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of 
proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional 
downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon Plasmodiophora brassicae infection 
implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis perk9 
mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, 
suggesting the negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity. The study highlighted 
the potential role of BnPERKs in crop improvement strategies against clubroot 
disease.

The phosphoinositide pathway and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) have been 
implicated in plant responses to many abiotic stresses; however, their role in 
response to biotic stress is not well characterized. In the current study, we 
show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are 
affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I 
inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced 
InsP3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca(2+)-release as well as the expressions of 
some flg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase plants. 
Furthermore, the InsP 5-ptase plants were more susceptible to virulent and 
avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. The InsP 
5-ptase plants had lower basal salicylic acid (SA) levels and the induction of 
SAR in systemic leaves was reduced and delayed. Reciprocal exudate experiments 
showed that although the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective 
molecules that could trigger PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants, exudates 
collected from either wild type or InsP 5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene 
expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally, expression profiles indicated 
that several defense genes including PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and AIG1 were basally 
down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type. Upon pathogen 
attack, expression of these genes was either not induced or showed delayed 
induction in systemic leaves. Our study shows that phosphoinositide signaling is 
one component of the plant defense network and is involved in both basal and 
systemic responses. The dampening of InsP3-mediated signaling affects Ca(2+) 
release, modulates defense gene expression and compromises plant defense 
responses.

Although many reports characterize the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis 
seedlings to microgravity, few investigate the effect of partial or fractional 
gravity on gene expression. Understanding plant responses to fractional gravity 
is relevant for plant growth on lunar and Martian surfaces. The plant signaling 
flight experiment utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) 
onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EMCS consisted of two rotors 
within a controlled chamber allowing for two experimental conditions, 
microgravity (stationary rotor) and simulated gravity in space. Seedlings were 
grown for 5 days under continuous light in seed cassettes. The arrangement of 
the seed cassettes within each experimental container results in a gradient of 
fractional g (in the spinning rotor). To investigate whether gene expression 
patterns are sensitive to fractional g, we carried out transcriptional profiling 
of root samples exposed to microgravity or partial g (ranging from 0.53 to 0.88 
g). Data were analyzed using DESeq2 with fractional g as a continuous variable 
in the design model in order to query gene expression across the gravity 
continuum. We identified a subset of genes whose expression correlates with 
changes in fractional g. Interestingly, the most responsive genes include those 
encoding transcription factors, defense, and cell wall-related proteins and heat 
shock proteins.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding how plants adapt to the space environment is 
essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space 
missions. Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional 
profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, 
there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences 
in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent 
response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of 
microgravity from other spaceflight effects.
METHODS: Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate 
spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing 
the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted 
environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 
1 g control.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR 
revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity 
between the two experiments. Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in 
transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light 
were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved 
in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca++ signaling, and cell wall modification 
were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress 
responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these 
pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to 
ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be 
upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; 
however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In 
addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (μ g) shoot 
samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) 
which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding 
target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the 
downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized 
enzymes and proteins. These results uncover microgravity unique transcriptional 
changes and highlight the validity and importance of an onboard 1 g control.

To understand the physiological changes that occur in response to spaceflight, 
mice are transported to the International Space Station (ISS) and housed for 
variable periods of time before euthanasia on-orbit or return to Earth. Sample 
collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that 
need to be identified and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome 
of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from 
mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. 
Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground 
samples, making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on 
experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass 
preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that 
differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with 
polyA selection. This has important implications for the interpretation of 
existing datasets and the design of future experiments.

BACKGROUND: The mollusk statocyst is a mechanosensing organ detecting the 
animal's orientation with respect to gravity. This system has clear similarities 
to its vertebrate counterparts: a weight-lending mass, an epithelial layer 
containing small supporting cells and the large sensory hair cells, and an 
output eliciting compensatory body reflexes to perturbations.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In terrestrial gastropod snail we studied the 
impact of 16- (Foton M-2) and 12-day (Foton M-3) exposure to microgravity in 
unmanned orbital missions on: (i) the whole animal behavior (Helix lucorum L.), 
(ii) the statoreceptor responses to tilt in an isolated neural preparation 
(Helix lucorum L.), and (iii) the differential expression of the Helix pedal 
peptide (HPep) and the tetrapeptide FMRFamide genes in neural structures (Helix 
aspersa L.). Experiments were performed 13-42 hours after return to Earth. 
Latency of body re-orientation to sudden 90° head-down pitch was significantly 
reduced in postflight snails indicating an enhanced negative gravitaxis 
response. Statoreceptor responses to tilt in postflight snails were independent 
of motion direction, in contrast to a directional preference observed in control 
animals. Positive relation between tilt velocity and firing rate was observed in 
both control and postflight snails, but the response magnitude was significantly 
larger in postflight snails indicating an enhanced sensitivity to acceleration. 
A significant increase in mRNA expression of the gene encoding HPep, a peptide 
linked to ciliary beating, in statoreceptors was observed in postflight snails; 
no differential expression of the gene encoding FMRFamide, a possible 
neurotransmission modulator, was observed.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Upregulation of statocyst function in snails following 
microgravity exposure parallels that observed in vertebrates suggesting 
fundamental principles underlie gravi-sensing and the organism's ability to 
adapt to gravity changes. This simple animal model offers the possibility to 
describe general subcellular mechanisms of nervous system's response to 
conditions on Earth and in space.

Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against 
malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from 
astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity 
present during spaceflight affects the body's defenses against leukemogenesis. 
Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated 
microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) 
cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This 
brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, 
and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq 
performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into 
the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of 
space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against 
MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut 
risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.

Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications in environmental, biomedical, agricultural, 
biological, and spaceflight research require an ion-selective electrode (ISE) 
that can withstand prolonged storage in complex biological media (1-4). An 
all-solid-state ion-selective-electrode (ASSISE) is especially attractive for 
the aforementioned applications. The electrode should have the following 
favorable characteristics: easy construction, low maintenance, and (potential 
for) miniaturization, allowing for batch processing. A microfabricated ASSISE 
intended for quantifying H(+), Ca(2+), and CO3(2-) ions was constructed. It 
consists of a noble-metal electrode layer (i.e. Pt), a transduction layer, and 
an ion-selective membrane (ISM) layer. The transduction layer functions to 
transduce the concentration-dependent chemical potential of the ion-selective 
membrane into a measurable electrical signal. The lifetime of an ASSISE is found 
to depend on maintaining the potential at the conductive layer/membrane 
interface (5-7). To extend the ASSISE working lifetime and thereby maintain 
stable potentials at the interfacial layers, we utilized the conductive polymer 
(CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) (7-9) in place of silver/silver 
chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the transducer layer. We constructed the ASSISE in a 
lab-on-a-chip format, which we called the multi-analyte biochip (MAB) (Figure 
1). Calibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH 
(operational range pH 4-9), CO3(2-) (measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca(2+) 
(log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian 
slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate 
biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional 
ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor 
biological activity of the model system, the microalga Chlorella vulgaris. The 
MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing 
capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on 
Earth or in space. Biochip Design and Experimental Methods The biochip is 10 x 
11 mm in dimension and has 9 ASSISEs designated as working electrodes (WEs) and 
5 Ag/AgCl reference electrodes (REs). Each working electrode (WE) is 240 μm in 
diameter and is equally spaced at 1.4 mm from the REs, which are 480 μm in 
diameter. These electrodes are connected to electrical contact pads with a 
dimension of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm. The schematic is shown in Figure 2. Cyclic 
voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic deposition methods are used to 
electropolymerize the PEDOT films using a Bioanalytical Systems Inc. (BASI) C3 
cell stand (Figure 3). The counter-ion for the PEDOT film is tailored to suit 
the analyte ion of interest. A PEDOT with poly(styrenesulfonate) counter ion 
(PEDOT/PSS) is utilized for H(+) and CO3(2-), while one with sulphate (added to 
the solution as CaSO4) is utilized for Ca(2+). The electrochemical properties of 
the PEDOT-coated WE is analyzed using CVs in redox-active solution (i.e. 2 mM 
potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6)). Based on the CV profile, Randles-Sevcik 
analysis was used to determine the effective surface area (10). Spin-coating at 
1,500 rpm is used to cast ~2 μm thick ion-selective membranes (ISMs) on the MAB 
working electrodes (WEs). The MAB is contained in a microfluidic flow-cell 
chamber filled with a 150 μl volume of algal medium; the contact pads are 
electrically connected to the BASI system (Figure 4). The photosynthetic 
activity of Chlorella vulgaris is monitored in ambient light and dark 
conditions.

The space race is entering a new era of exploration, in which the number of 
robotic and human missions to various places in our solar system is rapidly 
increasing. Despite the recent advances in propulsion and life support 
technologies, there is a growing need to perform analytical measurements and 
laboratory experiments across diverse domains of science, while keeping low 
payload requirements. In this context, lab-on-a-chip nanobiosensors appear to be 
an emerging technology capable of revolutionizing space exploration, given their 
low footprint, high accuracy, and low payload requirements. To date, only some 
approaches for monitoring astronaut health in spacecraft environments have been 
reported. Although non-invasive molecular diagnostics, like lab-on-a-chip 
technology, are expected to improve the quality of long-term space missions, 
their application to monitor microbiological and environmental variables is 
rarely reported, even for analogous extreme environments on Earth. The 
possibility of evaluating the occurrence of unknown or unexpected species, 
identifying redox gradients relevant to microbial metabolism, or testing for 
specific possible biosignatures, will play a key role in the future of space 
microbiology. In this review, we will examine the current and potential roles of 
lab-on-a-chip technology in space exploration and in extreme environment 
investigation, reporting what has been tested so far, and clarifying the 
direction toward which the newly developed technologies of portable 
lab-on-a-chip sensors are heading for exploration in extreme environments and in 
space.

The first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was for Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the 
zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently 
placed in the phyla Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota, were sequenced. The genome 
for Rhizopus delemar was completed in 2008; currently, more than 1000 zygomycete 
genomes have been sequenced. Genomic data from these early-diverging terrestrial 
fungi revealed deep phylogenetic separation of the two major clades-primarily 
plant-associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal Mucoromycota versus the primarily 
mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the 
Zoopagomycota. Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these 
fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including 
adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and 
co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have 
facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome 
duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization 
of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation 
processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications. Pathogenicity 
genes and specialized secondary metabolites have also been detected in soil 
saprobes and pathogenic fungi. Novel endosymbiotic bacteria and viruses have 
been discovered during several zygomycete genome projects. Overall, genomic 
information has helped to resolve a plethora of research questions, from the 
placement of zygomycetes on the evolutionary tree of life and in natural 
ecosystems, to the applied biotechnological and medical questions.

The motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in 
natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) 
distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and 
progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and 
blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell 
separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. Although it is 
known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns 
and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid 
flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in 
an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial 
distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle 
image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed 
the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the 
valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the 
feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of 
streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the 
vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear 
stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational 
characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid 
flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of 
relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell 
separation efficiency.

Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological 
responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and 
rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited 
number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, 
fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in 
anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. 
Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and 
extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. 
Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL 
showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying 
its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice 
shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal 
signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space 
flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on 
Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete 
life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and 
soleus responses. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular 
responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic 
knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies.

Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and 
increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, 
host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and 
periodontitis. However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing 
bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based 
simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, 
high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity 
cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, 
H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary 
phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by 
H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not 
affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was 
up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated 
microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes 
located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate 
metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results 
suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. 
mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered 
cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.

Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk 
factor for opportunistic infections. To gain insight into S. aureus virulence 
potential in the spaceflight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular 
proteomics, and metabolomics data from the ""Biological Research in Canisters-23"" 
(BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the 
response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space 
station. This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish 
Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight 
cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene 
Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene 
transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene 
transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes 
encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively 
regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions 
related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. 
We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which 
revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence 
factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease 
(Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. 
aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground 
controls. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased 
quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the 
spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.

The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is 
important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is 
required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and 
gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in 
eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the 
homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS 
function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and 
pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS 
subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not 
VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 
and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by 
phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which 
implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible 
knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and 
demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide 
evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate 
vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal 
VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and 
SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS-SNARE interactions, which is similar to 
other eukaryotes. These results highlight both conserved and specific mechanisms 
for HOPS recruitment and function during vacuole fusion in plants.

Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient 
structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic 
spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of 
membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a 
screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole 
morphology. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1), a mutant 
in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the 
parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than 
the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of 
transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the 
bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when 
transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very 
large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the 
cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is involved in the 
regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or 
stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs.

The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is 
important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is 
required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and 
gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in 
eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the 
homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS 
function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and 
pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS 
subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not 
VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 
and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by 
phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which 
implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible 
knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and 
demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide 
evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate 
vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal 
VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and 
SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS-SNARE interactions, which is similar to 
other eukaryotes. These results highlight both conserved and specific mechanisms 
for HOPS recruitment and function during vacuole fusion in plants.

The spaceflight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude 
of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to 
microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in 
gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall 
composition, antioxidant accumulation and modification of growth anisotropy. 
Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular 
organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been 
detected in previous flights. The prominent size of plant vacuoles makes them 
ideal models to study organelle dynamics in space. Here, we used Arabidopsis 
zigzag-1 (zig-1) as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on 
plant vacuole fusion. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings 
and a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol was developed to visualize plant 
vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy. Our results 
indicate that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl 
growth and vacuole fusion in some cells. This study demonstrates the feasibility 
of chemical inhibitor treatments for plant cell biology experiments in space.

Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation 
(hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and 
reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and 
lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup 
mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to 
pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone 
concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in 
circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue 
metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from 
mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day 
[P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and 
delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected 
for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO(2) and incorporation into 
lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using 
time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly 
reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, 
HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and 
insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose 
tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were 
altered by HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core 
clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. 
Gravity load alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic 
adaptations needed for a successful lactation.

DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere 
length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular 
modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term 
effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior. Here, 
we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere 
length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were 
exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males 
exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation (Bdnf IV) in the medial 
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed 
females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than 
controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal 
stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for 
behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking 
stress to intergenerational molecular changes.

Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for 
astronauts. However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to 
micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of 
this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones 
influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro 
and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher 
rats (n ​= ​120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. 
After two weeks recovery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), 
partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) 
interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were 
evaluated prior to and after interventions. At 0g, females lost more 
dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle 
size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these 
differences. Additionally, at 0.4g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, 
plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared to 
males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Females have 
greater musculoskeletal aberrations during exposure to both microgravity and 
partial-gravity environments; these differences are not dependent on the 
presence of sex steroid hormones. Correspondingly, additional interventions may 
be necessary to mitigate musculoskeletal loss in female astronauts to protect 
occupational and overall health.

Previous publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive 
regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell 
divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell 
differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also 
promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell 
differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1. In addition, BR and its 
BZR1-mediated signalling pathway are shown to alter the expression/subcellular 
distribution of pin-formed (PINs), which may result in changes in auxin 
movement. BR promotes intense nuclear accumulation of BZR1 in the root tip area, 
and the binding of BZR1 to the promoters of several root development-regulating 
genes, modulating their expression in the root stem cell niche area. These 
BZR1-mediated signalling cascades may account for both the ectopic activation of 
QC cell divisions as well as the suppression of the columella stem cell 
differentiation. They could also inhibit auxin-dependent distal stem cell 
differentiation by antagonizing the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. In conclusion, 
BZR1-/BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways show differential effects on the 
maintenance of root apical meristem activities: they stimulate ectopic QC 
division while they show opposite effects on the differentiation of distal 
columella stem cells in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner.

To understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to 
increased environmental temperature, 2-D difference gel electrophoresis was used 
to study the proteins in microsomes of Arabidopsis seedlings that are regulated 
early during heat stress. Using mass spectrometry, 19 microsomal proteins that 
showed an altered expression level within 5 min after heat treatment were 
identified. Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those 
up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show 
loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more 
sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing AtANN1 showed 
more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression 
of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double 
mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration 
([Ca(2+)]cyt) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetectable in 
ann1/ann2 double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is 
important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt and in the 
response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress.

A previous study has demonstrated that the treatment of Arabidopsis plants with 
chemical inhibitors of apyrase enzymes increases their sensitivity to 
herbicides. In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related 
apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to 
inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. 
The growth of all five fungi was partially inhibited by three commonly used 
fungicides: copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole. However, when 
these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four 
different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to 
inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative 
to their application alone. The apyrase inhibitors were most effective in 
potentiating the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit fungal growth, and least 
effective in combination with propiconazole. Among the five pathogens assayed, 
that most sensitive to the fungicide-potentiating effects of the inhibitors was 
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested 
(five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of 
apyrase inhibitors increased significantly the sensitivity of fungi to the 
fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted 
mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13 each increased the level of 
propiconazole retained in one of the fungi, suggesting that they could partially 
block the ability of efflux transporters to remove propiconazole from these 
fungi.

Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins 
that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional 
proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. 
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in 
their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we 
showed that ann-mutant seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased 
primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these 
mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without 
sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and 
chlorophyll accumulation was found in ann-mutant cotyledons compared to that in 
wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of ann-mutant 
seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of ann-mutant primary roots 
was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar. 
To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we 
examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that 
post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in ann-mutant root tips compared to 
that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root 
tips of ann-mutant seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would 
restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips. Our results indicate that 
ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root 
tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. 
This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.

Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced 
during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central 
nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the 
performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, 
sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw 
that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were 
mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the 
mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress 
response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out 
the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the 
underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured 
CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as 
changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) 
will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the 
MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated 
microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was 
mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the 
hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative 
correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between 
neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between 
molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these 
responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and 
prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle 
disuse on Earth.

In addition to muscle weakness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is 
associated with an increased incidence of skeletal fractures. The SOD1G93A mouse 
model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit 
decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the 
skeleton in SOD1G93A mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined 
skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1G93A female mice and healthy 
littermate female controls (N = 9-10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and 
cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and 
strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture 
toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference 
point indentation. SOD1G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower 
trabecular bone mass (-54%), thinner trabeculae (-41%) and decreased cortical 
bone thickness (-17%) and cortical area (-18%) compared to control mice (all 
p < 0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1G93A 
mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (-27%) and failure moment 
(-41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (-18%) (all p < 0.001). This is 
the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage 
ALS mice, and imply multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and 
fracture risk in patients in ALS. Importantly, our results provide strong 
rationale for interventions to reduce fracture risk in ALS patients with 
advanced disease.

In the near future, space agencies plan to send the first crews for extended 
stays on the Moon and Mars, where gravity is significantly reduced compared to 
Earth (0.16×g and 0.38×g, respectively). However, the long-term effects of 
partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts' health 
and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a quadrupedal 
partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the 
longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. We 
demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are significantly 
impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of 
suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the 
PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced 
weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and 
successful extraterrestrial exploration.

Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a tool utilized in rehabilitation and 
injury prevention to improve muscle strength and size, particularly in 
load-compromised individuals. BFRT facilitates gains in muscular strength and 
hypertrophy at lower loads, allowing for accelerated recovery and less disuse 
atrophy. BFRT must be applied appropriately and with caution, particularly in 
individuals with cardiovascular concerns. There are applications for BFRT across 
a wide spectrum of human performance training and in rehabilitation of both 
lower and upper extremity conditions, providing a high-quality adjunct to 
improve muscle strength, power, and endurance.

Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb 
suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course 
of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the 
musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing 
dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and 
skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and 
functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 
40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n = 11-12/group). Using 
in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia 
declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively 
with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of 
trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography 
revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. 
Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the 
decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. 
Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions 
in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that 
this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive 
and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on 
cortical bone.

For decades, scientists have relied on animals to understand the risks and 
consequences of space travel. Animals remain key to study the physiological 
alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about 
microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain 
costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample 
sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully 
created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. 
Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was 
developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar 
surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model 
closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of 
PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from 
its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address 
how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new 
paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and 
needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and 
future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the 
rat PWB model.

Ground-based animal models have been used extensively to understand the effects 
of microgravity on various physiological systems. Among them, hindlimb 
suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold-standard and 
allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind 
limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift. While this model has already 
brought valuable insights to space biology, few studies have directly compared 
functional decrements in the muscles of males and females during HLS. We exposed 
28 adult Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females) to 14 days of HLS or normal 
loading (NL) to better assess how sex impacts disuse-induced muscle 
deconditioning. Females better maintained muscle function during HLS than males, 
as shown by a more moderate reduction in grip strength at 7 days (males: 
-37.5 ± 3.1%, females: -22.4 ± 6.5%, compared to baseline), that remains stable 
during the second week of unloading (males: -53.3 ± 5.7%, females: -22.4 ± 5.5%, 
compared to day 0) while the males exhibit a steady decrease over time (effect 
of sex × loading p = 0.0002, effect of sex × time × loading p = 0.0099). This 
was further supported by analyzing the force production in response to a tetanic 
stimulus. Further functional analyses using force production were also shown to 
correspond to sex differences in relative loss of muscle mass and CSA. Moreover, 
our functional data were supported by histomorphometric analyzes, and we 
highlighted differences in relative muscle loss and CSA. Specifically, female 
rats seem to experience a lesser muscle deconditioning during disuse than males 
thus emphasizing the need for more studies that will assess male and female 
animals concomitantly to develop tailored, effective countermeasures for all 
astronauts.

BACKGROUND: Liquid cultures have been commonly used in space, toxicology, and 
pharmacology studies of Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the knowledge about 
transcriptomic alterations caused by liquid cultivation remains limited. 
Moreover, the impact of different genotypes in rapid adaptive responses to 
environmental changes (e.g., liquid cultivation) is often overlooked. Here, we 
report the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses of laboratory N2 and the 
wild-isolate AB1 strains after culturing P0 worms on agar plates, F1 in liquid 
cultures, and F2 back on agar plates.
RESULTS: Significant variations were found in the gene expressions between the 
N2 and AB1 strains in response to liquid cultivation. The results demonstrated 
that 8-34% of the environmental change-induced transcriptional responses are 
transmitted to the subsequent generation. By categorizing the gene expressions 
for genotype, environment, and genotype-environment interactions, we identified 
that the genotype has a substantial impact on the adaptive responses. Functional 
analysis of the transcriptome showed correlation with phenotypical changes. For 
example, the N2 strain exhibited alterations in both phenotype and gene 
expressions for germline and cuticle in axenic liquid cultivation. We found 
transcript evidence to approximately 21% of the computationally predicted genes 
in C. elegans by exposing the worms to environmental changes.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented study reveals substantial differences between N2 and 
AB1 strains for transcriptomic and phenotypical responses to rapid environmental 
changes. Our data can provide standard controls for future studies for the 
liquid cultivation of C. elegans and enable the discovery of condition-specific 
genes.

Given the growing interest in human exploration of space, it is crucial to 
identify the effects of space conditions on biological processes. Here, we 
analyze the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated 
microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning 
to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the 
simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after 
returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are 
reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass 
spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects 
longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, 
we identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated 
microgravity- and space-exposed worms. Overall, this work provides insight into 
the effect of microgravity on biological systems during and after exposure.

Studying microbes at the single-cell level in space can accelerate human space 
exploration both via the development of novel biotechnologies and via the 
understanding of cellular responses to space stressors and countermeasures. 
High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell 
populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance 
cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in 
nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a 
hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner 
aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, 
wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay 
protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell 
derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the 
addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the 
single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the 
recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week 
storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics 
changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh 
microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in 
viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed 
an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a 
proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived 
colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population 
that grows at an accelerated rate. Desiccated PicoShells thus provide a robust 
method for cell preservation before and during launch, promising a simple 
single-cell analysis method for studying heterogeneity in microbial populations 
in space.

The application of omics to study Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) in the 
context of spaceflight is increasing, illuminating the wide-ranging biological 
impacts of spaceflight on physiology. In this review, we highlight the 
application of omics, including transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, 
multi-omics, and integrated omics in the study of spaceflown C. elegans, and 
discuss the impact, use, and future direction of this branch of research. We 
highlight the variety of molecular alterations that occur in response to 
spaceflight, most notably changes in metabolic and neuromuscular gene 
regulation. These transcriptional features are reproducible and evident across 
many spaceflown species (e.g., mice and astronauts), supporting the use of 
C. elegans as a model organism to study spaceflight physiology with 
translational capital. Integrating tissue-specific, spatial, and multi-omics 
approaches, which quantitatively link molecular responses to phenotypic 
adaptations, will facilitate the identification of candidate regulatory 
molecules for therapeutic intervention and thus represents the next frontiers in 
C. elegans space omics research.

Bone loss caused by ionizing radiation is a potential health concern for 
radiotherapy patients, radiation workers and astronauts. In animal studies, 
exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, 
and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased 
bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate 
interventions with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities (antioxidant 
cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to 
blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after 
irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation 
(protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most 
effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption 
(Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α) and also preventing later cancellous bone 
decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions. Thus, 
dietary supplementation with DP may prevent the skeletal effects of radiation 
exposures either in space or on Earth.

Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can 
negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have 
previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented 
radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity 
of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated 
spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation 
exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone 
micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone 
and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect 
osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based 
on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective 
countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during 
spaceflight.

Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in 
physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the 
absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to 
extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on 
cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac 
responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading 
(HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity 
and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered 
expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, 
we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months 
of age) Long-Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days 
and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in 
oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene 
expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed 
elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In 
nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and 
normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. 
RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 
days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory 
signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes 
associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these 
findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and 
that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of 
countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition 
characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD 
remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of 
novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified 
cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug 
targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the 
outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 
individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed 
to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene 
Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment 
analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant 
genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the 
likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. 
The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD 
risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG 
enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the 
regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase 
activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The 
colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a 
causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 
97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most 
promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD. This study not only 
identifies potential therapeutic targets but also offers valuable insights for 
future drug development in the context of CKD.

Platelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. 
Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these 
proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are 
performed, a question we wanted to address for nuclear assembly protein 1like 1 
(NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, 
overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and 
functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34+-derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 
is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that 
dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, 
ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial 
pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in 
maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the 
respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of 
infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients 
demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH 
activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of 
NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, 
diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other 
than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial 
protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and 
thrombopoiesis.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) 
was developed as a self-contained rodent habitat for shuttle flight missions 
that provides inhabitants with living space, food, water, ventilation, and 
lighting, and this study reports whether, after minimal hardware modification, 
the AEM could support an extended term up to 35 days for Sprague-Dawley rats and 
C57BL/6 female mice for use on the International Space Station. Success was 
evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed 
and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and 
well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, 
organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of 
blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 
12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and 
water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 
days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated 
the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with 
minor hardware modification. Therefore, with modifications, it is possible to 
utilize this hardware on the International Space Station or other operational 
platforms to extend the space life science research use of mice and rats.

Fungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, 
piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although 
undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming 
species, including Penicillium rubens, have been identified in spacecraft, the 
effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent 
seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, 
Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. 
rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 
15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology 
and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of 
biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface 
area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in 
some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was 
the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and 
on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or 
spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, 
potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples 
and was material-dependent.

The adverse effects of microgravity exposure on mammalian physiology during 
spaceflight necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms to 
develop effective countermeasures. One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is 
partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in 
SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, 
multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data 
Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were 
employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA 
methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse 
soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the 
international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was 
introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either 
experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics 
features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to 
identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, 
with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related 
to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could 
serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle 
atrophy during space travel.

Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are 
rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this 
adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial 
adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains 
isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) 
bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly 
different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In 
addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate 
bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These 
prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in 
extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance 
and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial 
adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact 
human health in spaceflight.

Spaceflight and terrestrial spaceflight analogs can alter immune phenotypes. 
Macrophages are important immune cells that bridge the innate and adaptive 
immune systems and participate in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. 
Furthermore, macrophages are critically involved in initiating immunity, 
defending against injury and infection, and are also involved in immune 
resolution and wound healing. Heterogeneous populations of macrophage-type cells 
reside in many tissues and cause a variety of tissue-specific effects through 
direct or indirect interactions with other physiological systems, including the 
nervous and endocrine systems. It is vital to understand how macrophages respond 
to the unique environment of space to safeguard crew members with appropriate 
countermeasures for future missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. This review 
highlights current literature on macrophage responses to spaceflight and 
spaceflight analogs.

Whether terrestrial life can withstand the martian environment is of paramount 
interest for planetary protection measures and space exploration. To understand 
microbial survival potential in Mars-like conditions, several fungal and 
bacterial samples were launched in September 2019 on a large NASA scientific 
balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) where radiation 
levels resembled values at the equatorial Mars surface. Fungal spores of 
Aspergillus niger and bacterial cells of Salinisphaera shabanensis, 
Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 were 
launched inside the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and 
Biological Outcomes Experiment) payload filled with an artificial martian 
atmosphere and pressure throughout the mission profile. The dried microorganisms 
were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation (UV dose = 1148 kJ m-2) or were 
shielded from radiation. After the 5-h stratospheric exposure, samples were 
assayed for survival and metabolic changes. Spores from the fungus A. niger and 
cells from the Gram-(-) bacterium S. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 
2- and 4-log reduction, respectively. Exposed Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was 
completely inactivated (both with and without UV exposure) and S. capitis subsp. 
capitis only survived the UV shielded experimental condition (3-log reduction). 
Our results underscore a wide variation in survival phenotypes of spacecraft 
associated microorganisms and support the hypothesis that pigmented fungi may be 
resistant to the martian surface if inadvertently delivered by spacecraft 
missions.

Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to 
biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be 
directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a 
substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of 
fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be 
blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used 
interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of 
biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to 
biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends 
have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, 
but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ). To measure in situ 
microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, 
we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two 
locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and 
measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the 
fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial 
populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, and 
Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same 
taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae, not yet 
widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the 
Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative 
abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible 
fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between 
fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms 
responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To our 
knowledge this is the first in situ study of this scale incorporating community 
and corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment.

Earthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before 
catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the 
crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge 
carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume 
into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which 
generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will 
lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may 
fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow 
and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach 
the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and 
(ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they 
build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air 
molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending 
major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical 
research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress 
hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, 
positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the 
charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, 
plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic 
animals.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the 
coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 
million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing 
no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. 
Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold 
nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or 
virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time 
period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman 
spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, 
which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au-S bond. In the presence of 
COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen-antibody interaction, 
the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, 
which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very 
rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for 
COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form 
""hot spots"" to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike 
antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light-matter 
interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 
4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in ""hot spot"" positions when gold 
nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported 
data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold 
nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even 
at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 
virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which 
express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human 
cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the 
capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that 
antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby 
inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection 
and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the 
virus.

The emergence of double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has dropped vaccine 
effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although COVID-19 is responsible for 
more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are 
asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the first time that human host 
defense neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 
peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent 
the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta 
variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with 
host cells' angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that 
due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate 
GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the fluorescence 
signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a 
nonlinear Stern-Volmer quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding 
sites. Using the modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the 
effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with the ACE2-spike protein 
binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, 
experimental data shows that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 
variant is higher than those for the other variants. Further investigation using 
the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the 
capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 
pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2-spike protein binding. 
Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide- and 
HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one type of 
peptide-attached GQDs.

PURPOSE: Intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) and other 
sulfated polysaccharides are potential prophylactics for COVID-19. The purpose 
of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of 
intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity.
METHODS: Double-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses 
(60 ng to 60 μg) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both 
blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The 
pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were 
measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with 
nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human 
subjects.
RESULTS: UFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No 
significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only 
control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, 
international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline 
measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a 
mouse model showed a single phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 
12 h, 3.2% of the administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to 
background levels by 48 h.
CONCLUSIONS: UFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in 
mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution 
from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 h 
after dosing.

The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research 
efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein 
(S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its 
capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) 
and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 
virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid 
evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the 
S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted 
inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding 
domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) 
confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans 
(MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via 
competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the 
potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. 
In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 
activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with 
S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. 
Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, 
no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be 
drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of 
inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface 
proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then 
by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, 
HS-virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate 
from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human 
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were 
infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) 
fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The 
virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the 
purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B 
(R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV 
specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of 
the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS 
and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; 
moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. 
In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of 
this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral 
effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential 
prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.

Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic 
cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR 
particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily 
penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have 
shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, 
Varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during 
stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and 
the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular 
processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating 
latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs 
gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton 
ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the 
cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral 
genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the 
compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of 
transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic 
replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong 
contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

Collection and processing of tissues to preserve space flight effects from 
animals after return to Earth is challenging. Specimens must be harvested with 
minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in 
protein expression/translation, posttranslational modifications, and expression, 
as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after 
euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for 
determining the window of optimal species-specific and tissue-specific 
posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator 
Biospecimen Sharing Programs. We also determined methods for ISS-compatible 
long-term tissue storage (10 months at -80°C) that yield recovery of high 
quality mRNA and protein for western analysis after sample return. Our focus was 
reproductive tissues. The time following euthanasia where tissues could be 
collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and 
species ranging between 1 and 3 hours. RNA quality was preserved in key 
reproductive tissues fixed in RNAlater up to 40 min after euthanasia. 
Postfixation processing was also standardized for safe shipment back to our 
laboratory. Our strategy can be adapted for other tissues under NASA's 
Biospecimen Sharing Program or similar multi-investigator tissue sharing 
opportunities.

Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular 
level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend 
molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and 
humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling 
in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we 
observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant 
hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, 
metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, 
specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, 
spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. 
Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, 
estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly 
suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive 
endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful 
interplanetary species.

The musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment; this is of 
particular concern under conditions such as disuse, paralysis, and 
extended-duration space flight. Although structural and mechanical changes to 
tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a 
pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface 
(enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated 
these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were 
paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading 
significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with 
structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, 
unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased 
bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the 
nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the 
bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical 
testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of 
stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to 
failure, thereby increasing injury risk. These first observations of the 
multiscale effects of unloading on the adult enthesis provide new insight into 
the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis 
with increased resistance to failure. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The

Despite a wealth of data on the effects of spaceflight on tendons and bones, 
little is known about its effects on the interfacial tissue between these two 
structures, the enthesis. Mice were sent to space on three separate missions: 
STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 to determine how spaceflight affects the 
composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the 
humerus-supraspinatus and calcaneus-Achilles entheses. At the nanoscale, 
spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to 
increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to 
osteoclastogenesis (CatK, Tnfsf11) and mature osteoblasts (Col1, Osc). Tendons 
showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have 
resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation 
(Mmp3, Mmp13). These nanoscale changes did not result in micro- and milliscale 
changes to the structure and mechanics of the enthesis. There were no changes in 
bone volume, trabecular structure, failure load, or stiffness with spaceflight. 
This lack of tissue-level change may be anatomy based, as extremities may be 
less sensitive to spaceflight than central locations such as vertebrae, yet 
results highlight that the tendon enthesis may be robust against negative 
effects of spaceflight.

BACKGROUND: Space environment imposes a range of challenges to mammalian 
physiology and the gut microbiota, and interactions between the two are thought 
to be important in mammalian health in space. While previous findings have 
demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during 
spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and 
the functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain 
elusive.
METHODS: We profiled the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in 
fecal samples collected from mice after a 37-day spaceflight onboard the 
International Space Station. We developed an analytical tool, named STARMAPs 
(Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns), 
to compare microbiome changes reported here to other relevant datasets. We also 
integrated the gut microbiome data with the publically available transcriptomic 
data in the liver of the same animals for a systems-level analysis.
RESULTS: We report an elevated microbiome alpha diversity and an altered 
microbial community structure that were associated with spaceflight environment. 
Using STARMAPs, we found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with 
data reported in mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting 
reproducibility of the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. However, 
such changes were not comparable with those induced by space-type radiation in 
Earth-based studies. We found spaceflight led to significantly altered taxon 
abundance in one order, one family, five genera, and six species of microbes. 
This was accompanied by a change in the inferred microbial gene abundance that 
suggests an altered capacity in energy metabolism. Finally, we identified host 
genes whose expression in the liver were concordantly altered with the inferred 
gut microbial gene content, particularly highlighting a relationship between 
host genes involved in protein metabolism and microbial genes involved in 
putrescine degradation.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations shed light on the specific environmental factors 
that contributed to a robust effect on the gut microbiome during spaceflight 
with important implications for mammalian metabolism. Our findings represent a 
key step toward a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in 
mammalian health during spaceflight and provide a basis for future efforts to 
develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew health 
during long-term human space expeditions.

A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported 
in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a 
negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function 
mutations in kit receptor (kit(W/W-v)) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia 
or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat 
contributes to the development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response 
to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow 
adipocyte-deficient kit(W/W-v) mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and 
sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy 
by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and 
lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. 
Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone 
perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted 
in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, 
but the response was attenuated in the in kit(W/W-v) mice. Adipocytes were 
present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow 
adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not 
detected in either intact or ovx kit(W/W-v) mice. However, ovx in WT and 
kit(W/W-v) mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical 
and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and 
cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters. In conclusion, our 
findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a 
mediator of ovx-induced osteopenia in mice.

The present studies investigated the cellular mechanisms for the detrimental 
effects of high dose whole body γ-irradiation on bone. In addition, 
radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions 
to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation. Increased trabecular 
thickness and separation and reduced cancellous bone volume fraction, 
connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and 
lumbar vertebra 14days following γ-irradiation with 6Gy. To establish the 
cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by 
histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14days following irradiation. Marrow cell density 
decreased within 1day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 
3days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14days (30% 
reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation. In contrast, osteoblast-lined bone 
perimeter was increased by 290% (1day, p=0.04), 1230% (3days, p<0.0001), and 
530% (14days, p=0.003), respectively. There was a strong association between 
radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to 
express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation -0.85, p<0.0001). An 
increase (p=0.004) in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter was also detected with 
irradiation. A priming dose of γ-radiation (0.5mGy), previously shown to reduce 
mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not 
prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation 
normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone 
architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of 
marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, 
at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone 
resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter. Bone marrow transplantation is 
effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of acute exposure to high dose 
whole body γ-radiation on bone turnover.

Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass 
and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin 
deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, 
architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in WT mice, ob/ob 
mice allowed to feed ad libitum (ob/ob), and ob/ob mice pair-fed equivalent to 
WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob). Mice were maintained at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 6 
to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. ob/ob 
mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were 
hyperglycemic compared with WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) 
and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in 
ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume (BV) fraction was higher but 
indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob mice compared with 
WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological 
retention of calcified cartilage. Pair-fed ob/ob mice were lighter and had lower 
WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose than ob/ob mice. Similarly, femoral 
length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared 
with ob/ob mice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In 
contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage, and cancellous BV fraction 
were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared with 
ob/ob mice. These findings indicate that the skeletal abnormalities caused by 
leptin deficiency are markedly attenuated in morbidly obese ob/ob mice.

Excessive weight gain in adults is associated with a variety of negative health 
outcomes. Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions 
have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in 
detrimental side effects, including accelerating age-related cancellous bone 
loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as 
an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9 months old) 
female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone 
mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx 
and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the 
hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus 
encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector encoding 
green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n=10) and sacrificed 18 weeks later. A 
baseline control group (n=7) was sacrificed at vector administration. 
rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight (-4±2%) while rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained 
weight (14±2%) during the study. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats 
weighed 17% less than rAAV-GFP-treated rats and had lower abdominal white 
adipose tissue weight (-80%), serum leptin (-77%), and serum IGF1 (-34%). 
Cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, and in 
lumbar vertebra tended to be lower (P<0.1) in rAAV-GFP-treated rats (13.5 months 
old) compared to baseline control rats (9 months old). Significant differences 
in cancellous bone or biomarkers of bone turnover were not detected between 
rAAV-Leptin and rAAV-GFP rats. In summary, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats maintained a 
lower body weight compared to baseline and rAAV-GFP-treated rats with minimal 
effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or biochemical markers of bone 
turnover.

Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since 
osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) 
progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast 
formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and 
bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are 
associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone 
formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and 
increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. 
Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on 
marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant 
adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male ob/ob 
mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) 
rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For 
vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either 
rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 10(7) particles) and 
maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic 
leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were 
randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 
7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to 
a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice 
fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in 
MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. 
Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast 
perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy 
decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values 
similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an 
important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and 
osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the 
results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not 
necessarily result in increased bone mass.

Room temperature housing (22 °C) results in premature cancellous bone loss in 
female mice. The bone loss was prevented by housing mice at thermoneutral 
temperature (32 °C). Thermogenesis differs markedly between mice and humans and 
mild cold stress induced by standard room temperature housing may introduce an 
unrecognized confounding variable into preclinical studies.
INTRODUCTION: Female mice are often used as preclinical models for osteoporosis 
but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss during growth. 
Mice are routinely housed at room temperature (18-23 °C), a strategy that 
exaggerates physiological differences in thermoregulation between mice 
(obligatory daily heterotherms) and humans (homeotherms). The purpose of this 
investigation was to assess whether housing female mice at thermoneutral 
(temperature range where the basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium 
with heat loss) alters bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture.
METHODS: Growing (4-week-old) female C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice were housed at 
either 22 or 32 °C for up to 18 weeks.
RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice housed at 22 °C experienced a 62 % cancellous bone loss 
from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8 to 18 weeks of age 
and lesser bone loss from the distal femur epiphysis, whereas cancellous and 
cortical bone mass in 32 °C-housed mice were unchanged or increased. The impact 
of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone was not limited to C57BL/6J mice as 
C3H/HeJ mice exhibited a similar skeletal response. The beneficial effects of 
thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone were associated with decreased Ucp1 
gene expression in brown adipose tissue, increased bone marrow adiposity, higher 
rates of bone formation, higher expression levels of osteogenic genes and 
locally decreased bone resorption.
CONCLUSIONS: Housing female mice at 22 °C resulted in premature cancellous bone 
loss. Failure to account for species differences in thermoregulation may 
seriously confound interpretation of studies utilizing mice as preclinical 
models for osteoporosis.

There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and 
osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast 
differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal 
relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we 
evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, 
bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. 
Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control 
or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar 
vertebrae (n=11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous 
quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground 
controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher 
MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) 
and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged 
during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and 
osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The 
present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae 
during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no 
change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that 
increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. 
However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during 
spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating 
defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis 
that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the 
expense of forming osteoblasts.

The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and 
axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important 
procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is 
also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present 
study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different 
growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as 
wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone 
length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that 
ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice (p < 
0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins 
and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal 
growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01). Spearman's analysis 
showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to 
the expression level of ERα in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice 
are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERα 
antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERβ antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 
mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP 
and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, 
the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems 
to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. 
These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be 
associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in 
ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by 
leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and 
leptin needs to be explored in future work.

Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral 
ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, 
leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the 
extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin 
treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing 
histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly 
growing (4-month-old) and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild-type (WT) and 
ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix 
persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis 
in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely 
self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic 
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin 
signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of the three 
groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin or (3) control vector rAAV-green 
fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months 
later, rAAV-leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and 
greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, 
the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These 
findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement 
of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is 
bone-compartment-specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of 
undergoing robust bone turnover.

Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, 
maturation and turnover. Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum 
levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the 
central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across 
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact 
of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone 
formation and compared the response with well-established centrally mediated 
actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 
140 or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n = 8/group) 
using sc-implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated 
increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 
infusion rates of 7-17 ng/h, whereas higher levels (EC50, 40-80 ng/h) were 
required to similarly influence indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed 
gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; 
the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion 
with 12 ng/h leptin increased the expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat 
signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling 
and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts 
peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited 
transport across the BBB insures that the growth-promoting actions of peripheral 
leptin are not curtailed by the hormone's CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.

Bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is negatively associated with bone mass. Since 
osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same precursor cells, adipocyte 
differentiation may occur at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. We used 
MAT-deficient KitW/W-v (MAT-) mice to determine if absence of MAT reduced bone 
loss in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice. Male MAT- and wild-type (WT) mice were 
randomly assigned to a baseline, control or HU group (n = 10 mice/group) within 
each genotype and HU groups unloaded for 2 weeks. Femurs were evaluated using 
micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and targeted gene profiling. MAT- 
mice had a greater reduction in bone volume fraction after HU than did WT mice. 
HU MAT- mice had elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption compared to 
other treatment groups as well as a unique profile of differentially expressed 
genes. Adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells 
reconstituted c-kit but not MAT in KitW/W-v mice. The MAT- WT → KitW/W-v mice 
lost cancellous bone following 2 weeks of HU. In summary, results from this 
study suggest that MAT deficiency was not protective, and was associated with 
exaggerated disuse-induced cancellous bone loss.

The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on 
the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, 
including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and 
hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the 
expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its 
role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. 
Mrc1-/- mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 
20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and 
insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, 
histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1-/- 
mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors 
and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to 
controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory 
monocytes decreased in Mrc1-/- mice together with reduced infiltration of 
macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. 
Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed 
that Mrc1-/- mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of 
proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was 
reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain 
during HFD feeding in Mrc1-/- mice compared to controls. Our data show that 
during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating 
immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and 
resistance to obesity development.

Total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by transfer of bone marrow cells from 
donors is routinely performed in immunology research and can be used to 
manipulate differentiation and/or function of bone cells. However, exposure to 
high-dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of 
heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The 
goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone 
marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells 
(HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. Gamma-irradiated (9 Gy) 
WBB6F1 mice were engrafted with bone marrow cells (5 × 106 cells) or purified 
HSCs (3,000 cells) obtained from GFP transgenic mice. In vivo analysis and in 
vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established that both 
methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with 
donor-derived cells. We confirmed these findings by engrafting C57Bl/6 (B6) mice 
with bone marrow cells or purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic mice. We next 
performed adoptive transfer of purified HSCs (750 cells) into WBB6F1 and 
radiosensitive KitW/W-v mice and evaluated the skeleton two months later. 
Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice 
that received fractionated doses of 2 × 5 Gy. Kitw/wv mice lost weight and 
became osteopenic after 2 × 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were 
negligible after 5 Gy irradiation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of wild-type 
cells into Kitw/wv mice restored normal Kit expression in bone marrow. Together, 
these findings provide strong evidence for efficient engraftment with purified 
HSCs after lethal TBI with minimal collateral damage to bone. This approach will 
be useful for investigating mechanisms by which hematopoietic lineage cells 
regulate bone metabolism.

Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone 
than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to 
weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response 
of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were 
individually housed at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly 
growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then 
randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) 
ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob 
mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in 
distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and 
density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra 
(LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal 
femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes 
was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, 
leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, 
suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting.

Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in 
contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal 
maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. 
However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a 
critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J 
mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of 
energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we 
determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. 
Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or 
thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) 
weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous 
bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these 
effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral 
temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on 
histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of 
bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to 
mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone 
marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum 
leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous 
bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published 
data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical 
experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate 
aging-related changes in bone metabolism.

Mechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an 
important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone 
microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats 
subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing 
ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in 
animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat 
skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, 
strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we 
evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 
10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day 
mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. 
Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray 
microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume 
fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to 
flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In 
ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals 
compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical 
thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings 
from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in 
cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.

Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed aboard the International 
Space Station after 37 days of flight (RR-1 mission) and frozen carcasses 
returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue 
(BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Spaceflight resulted in 
differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non-shivering 
thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with 
increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and β-oxidation.

Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis 
of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as 
are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. We 
performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in 
temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female 
C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously 
implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and 
mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were 
maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in 
leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression 
of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent 
body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. 
Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal 
femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by 
pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 
6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated 
(0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. 
Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22°C), BMAT increased in ob/ob mice as 
well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased 
temperature. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having 
negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, 
attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and 
increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.

Mice are typically housed at temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone. 
When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold 
stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the 
skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold 
temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if 
alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, 
influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small 
differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing 
with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old 
mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) 
baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group 
housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Mice in the baseline group were 
sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were 
maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks 
until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room 
temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased 
cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone 
loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 °C or 
group housed at 22 °C. In conclusion, by impacting thermogenesis or heat loss, 
modest differences in housing conditions could influence experimental results.

Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an 
expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy 
requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. We investigated whether BMAT 
is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, 
WT) and BMAT-deficient WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW-v/J (KitW/W-v) mice were lethally 
irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, 
bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs 
from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal 
response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral 
blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph 
nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and 
BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but 
absent or rare in KitW/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, 
density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few 
differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest 
that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following 
lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of 
kit signaling-deficient mice.

Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments 
through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). 
This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant 
health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space 
missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could 
occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured 
under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two 
AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were 
tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor 
those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that 
were co-cultured with A. pittii under SMG had a significantly higher number of 
isolates that were now blaOXA-500- and ISAba1-positive compared to growth at 1G. 
The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as 
these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously 
susceptible to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the first time, increased 
HGT activity under SMG and the potential impact of the space environment in 
promoting increased gene dissemination within bacterial communities.

During space missions, astronauts are faced with a variety of challenges that 
are unique to spaceflight and that have been known to cause physiological 
changes in humans over a period of time. Several of these changes occur at the 
microbiome level, a complex ensemble of microbial communities residing in 
various anatomic sites of the human body, with a pivotal role in regulating the 
health and behavior of the host. The microbiome is essential for day-to-day 
physiological activities, and alterations in microbiome composition and function 
have been linked to various human diseases. For these reasons, understanding the 
impact of spaceflight and space conditions on the microbiome of astronauts is 
important to assess significant health risks that can emerge during long-term 
missions and to develop countermeasures. Here, we review various conditions that 
are caused by long-term space exploration and discuss the role of the microbiome 
in promoting or ameliorating these conditions, as well as space-related factors 
that impact microbiome composition. The topics explored pertain to microgravity, 
radiation, immunity, bone health, cognitive function, gender differences and 
pharmacomicrobiomics. Connections are made between the trifecta of spaceflight, 
the host and the microbiome, and the significance of these interactions for 
successful long-term space missions.

Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial 
resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is 
relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth-orbit, 
but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space 
waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose 
and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish 
sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. 
Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will 
be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental 
issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Locomotion of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a key observable used in 
investigations ranging from behavior to neuroscience to aging. However, while 
the natural environment of this model organism is 3D, quantitative 
investigations of its locomotion have been mostly limited to 2D motion. Here, we 
present a quantitative analysis of how the nematode reorients itself in 3D 
media. We identify a unique behavioral state of C. elegans-a roll maneuver-which 
is an essential component of 3D locomotion in burrowing and swimming. The rolls, 
associated with nonzero torsion of the nematode body, result in rotation of the 
plane of dorsoventral body undulations about the symmetry axis of the 
trajectory. When combined with planar turns in a new undulation plane, the rolls 
allow the nematode to reorient its body in any direction, thus enabling complete 
exploration of 3D space. The rolls observed in swimming are much faster than the 
ones in burrowing; we show that this difference stems from a purely hydrodynamic 
enhancement mechanism and not from a gait change or an increase in the body 
torsion. This result demonstrates that hydrodynamic viscous forces can enhance 
3D reorientation in undulatory locomotion, in contrast to known hydrodynamic 
hindrance of both forward motion and planar turns.

Development of a size-separation technique to isolate Caenorhabditis elegans 
embryos using mesh filters.

The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study 
gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. Most 
experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific 
developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a 
population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the 
embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but 
often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes 
as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they 
are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged 
animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using 
mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate 
than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond 
microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on 
downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the 
differences in the sizes of C. elegans developmental stages to isolate embryo 
cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays.

Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines 
in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, 
aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model 
C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular 
mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on 
diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are 
essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have 
not been recapitulated in the C. elegans model since force generation fluctuates 
based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based 
system for strength measurement that we call 'NemaFlex', based on pillar 
deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized 
the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that 
yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation 
studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can 
reliably score muscular strength in C. elegans. Additionally, we report a 
scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics 
model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our 
findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for 
defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for 
dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.

Regular physical exercise is the most efficient and accessible intervention 
known to promote healthy aging in humans. The molecular and cellular mechanisms 
that mediate system-wide exercise benefits, however, remain poorly understood, 
especially as applies to tissues that do not participate directly in training 
activity. The establishment of exercise protocols for short-lived genetic models 
will be critical for deciphering fundamental mechanisms of transtissue exercise 
benefits to healthy aging. Here we document optimization of a long-term swim 
exercise protocol for Caenorhabditis elegans and we demonstrate its benefits to 
diverse aging tissues, even if exercise occurs only during a restricted phase of 
adulthood. We found that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise 
adaptation, leading to body wall muscle improvements in structural gene 
expression, locomotory performance, and mitochondrial morphology. Swim exercise 
training enhances whole-animal health parameters, such as mitochondrial 
respiration and midlife survival, increases functional healthspan of the pharynx 
and intestine, and enhances nervous system health by increasing learning ability 
and protecting against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer's 
disease, and Huntington's disease. Remarkably, swim training only during early 
adulthood induces long-lasting systemic benefits that in several cases are still 
detectable well into midlife. Our data reveal the broad impact of swim exercise 
in promoting extended healthspan of multiple C. elegans tissues, underscore the 
potency of early exercise experience to influence long-term health, and 
establish the foundation for exploiting the powerful advantages of this genetic 
model for the dissection of the exercise-dependent molecular circuitry that 
confers system-wide health benefits to aging adults.

Biology experiments in space seek to increase our understanding of what happens 
to life beyond Earth and how we can safely send life beyond Earth. Spaceflight 
is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physiology, including decline in 
musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems. Biological 
experiments in space are inherently challenging to implement. Development of 
hardware and validation of experimental conditions are critical to ensure the 
collection of high-quality data. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has 
been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand 
spaceflight-induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceflight-induced muscle 
decline. These experiments have used a variety of hardware configurations. 
Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most recent 
experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design 
and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of 
many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting C. elegans experiments 
onboard the International Space Station. Here, we describe the hardware 
selection and validation, in addition to the ground-based experiment scientific 
validation testing. These experiences and operational solutions allow others to 
replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions.

Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. 
The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of 
aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an 
ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master 
regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and 
oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation 
of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties 
may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, 
resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans. We found that TCE 
supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased (p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of 
wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. 
Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated (p < 0.05) expression of 
longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) 
and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2. Further, we showed that TCE 
supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not 
change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our 
findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through 
enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the 
DAF-16 pathway.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins 
(up 8081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required 
for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 
isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in 
arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin 
and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647-742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain 
and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain ""interkinase 
region"" has low sequence complexity, has high proline content, and lacks 
predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this 
interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule 
force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as 
an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame 
deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals 
display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall 
muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to 
the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes 
with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force 
generation. We designed our CRISPR-generatedin-frame deletion to contain an HA 
tag at the N terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in 
normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal 
levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, 
small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional 
uptake.

In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the 
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and 
health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an 
optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that 
separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture 
maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the 
adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena 
geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and 
emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, 
feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of 
standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the 
need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, 
negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the 
swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show 
that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces 
lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of 
age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with 
longevity analyses of classical aging mutants (daf-2, age-1, eat-2, and daf-16) 
and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes (age-1 and daf-16). 
We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and 
tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the 
NemaLife chip. Overall, the capacity to generate reliable lifespan and 
physiological data underscores the potential of the NemaLife chip to accelerate 
healthspan and lifespan investigations in C. elegans.

Extended space travel is a goal of government space agencies and private 
companies. However, spaceflight poses risks to human health, and the effects on 
the nervous system have to be better characterized. Here, we exploited the 
unique experimental advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to explore 
how spaceflight affects adult neurons in vivo. We found that animals that lived 
5 days of adulthood on the International Space Station exhibited hyperbranching 
in PVD and touch receptor neurons. We also found that, in the presence of a 
neuronal proteotoxic stress, spaceflight promotes a remarkable accumulation of 
neuronal-derived waste in the surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired 
transcellular degradation of debris released from neurons. Our data reveal that 
spaceflight can significantly affect adult neuronal morphology and clearance of 
neuronal trash, highlighting the need to carefully assess the risks of 
long-duration spaceflight on the nervous system and to develop adequate 
countermeasures for safe space exploration.

Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the 
International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on 
changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies 
showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased 
expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the 
decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, 
specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex 
microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman 
et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device 
and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations 
considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, 
and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a 
microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from 
unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling 
protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device 
that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals 
in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with 
the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and 
prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment. Collectively, these 
technical advances enabled the development of new microfluidics-integrated 
hardware for spaceflight studies in C. elegans. Finally, we report Earth-based 
validation studies to test this new hardware, which has led to it being flown to 
the International Space Station.

The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is used in a variety of applications 
ranging from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease 
modeling, and to space-biology investigations. These applications rely on 
conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and 
locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) 
that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping 
of C. elegans. The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require 
mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint 
of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from 
plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for 
temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with 
different C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass 
slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and 
thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement 
with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that 
the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, 
we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable 
to future C. elegans investigations on the International Space Station, where 
science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew 
time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP 
desirable for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in 
space.

Living longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health 
(""health span"") is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic 
strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial 
metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H2S concentrations can pro health 
span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide 
delivery molecules (mtH2S) administered across the adult life course are 
unknown. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans aging model, we compared untargeted H2S 
(NaGYY4137, 100 µM and 100 nM) and mtH2S (AP39, 100 nM) donor effects on life 
span, neuromuscular health span, and mitochondrial integrity. H2S donors were 
administered from birth or in young/middle-aged animals (day 0, 2, or 4 
postadulthood). RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network 
analysis explored molecular events governing mtH2S donor-mediated health span. 
Developmentally administered mtH2S (100 nM) improved life/health span vs. 
equivalent untargeted H2S doses. mtH2S preserved aging mitochondrial structure, 
content (citrate synthase activity) and neuromuscular strength. Knockdown of H2S 
metabolism enzymes and FoxO/daf-16 prevented the positive health span effects of 
mtH2S, whereas DCAF11/wdr-23 - Nrf2/skn-1 oxidative stress protection pathways 
were dispensable. Health span, but not life span, increased with all adult-onset 
mtH2S treatments. Adult mtH2S treatment also rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by 
minimizing expression declines of mitochondria and cytoskeletal components, and 
peroxisome metabolism hub components, under mechanistic control by the 
elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor circuit. H2S health span extension likely acts 
at the mitochondrial level, the mechanisms of which dissociate from life span 
across adult vs. developmental treatment timings. The small mtH2S doses required 
for health span extension, combined with efficacy in adult animals, suggest 
mtH2S is a potential healthy aging therapeutic.

BACKGROUND: Age-related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous 
health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia 
without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing 
pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies 
suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of 
bisphosphonates as an anti-sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.
METHODS: Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals 
with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan 
and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of 
ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP-tagged myofibres or mitochondria at 
days 0, 4 and 6 post-adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA-mediated healthspan extension 
were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the 
life-course.
RESULTS: We found 100 nM and 1 μM ZA increased lifespan (P < 0.001) and 
healthspan [954 ± 53 (100 nM) and 963 ± 48 (1 μM) vs. 834 ± 59% (untreated) 
population activity AUC, P < 0.05]. 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (P < 0.0001) but 
not healthspan (758.9 ± 37 vs. 834 ± 59, P > 0.05), whereas 100 and 500 μM ZA 
were larval lethal. ZA (1 μM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on 
days 4 and 6 post-adulthood (83 and 71% well-organized myofibres, respectively, 
vs. 56 and 34% controls, P < 0.0001) and increased well-networked mitochondria 
at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls, P < 0.01). Genes required for ZA-mediated 
healthspan extension included fdps-1/FDPS-1 (278 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population 
activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively, 
P < 0.0001), daf-16/FOXO (680 ± 16 vs. 894 ± 17%, P < 0.01) and agxt-2/BAIBA 
(531 ± 23 vs. 552 ± 8%, P > 0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through 
knockdown of igdb-1/FNDC5 (635 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in 
gene knockdown vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01) and sir-2.3/SIRT-4 (586 ± 10 
vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA co-treatment 
vs. knockdown alone [651 ± 12 vs. 635 ± 10% (igdb-1/FNDC5) and 583 ± 9 vs. 
586 ± 10% (sir-2.3/SIRT-4), both P > 0.05]. Conversely, let-756/FGF21 and 
sir-2.2/SIRT-4 were dispensable for ZA-induced healthspan [630 ± 6 vs. 523 ± 10% 
population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01 
(let-756/FGF21) and 568 ± 9 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05 (sir-2.2/SIRT-4)].
CONCLUSIONS: Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans 
sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life 
course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable 
anti-sarcopenia therapy.

Background: Understanding and countering the well-established negative health 
consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep 
space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of 
space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the 
'typical' spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype-phenotype 
associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic 
utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. 
Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of 
space biology, combined with 'NemaFlex-S' microfluidic devices for assessing 
animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological 
responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) 
were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media 
before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess 
individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before 
returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. 
Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls 
(16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 
0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures 
characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate 
previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response 
pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional 
gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, 
including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in 
space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 
transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 
animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting 
strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes 
these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly 
reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced 
neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in 
calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote 
targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending 
animals and people into deep space in the near future.

In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that 
are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is 
usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use 
metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member 
Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective 
target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer 
Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted 
precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric 
acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further 
assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm 
host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective 
tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for 
future microbiome-targeted therapies.IMPORTANCEWhile various mechanisms through 
which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been 
identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted 
manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based 
therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to 
boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a 
microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision 
prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans 
comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent 
colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. 
Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm 
that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11 in vitro and 
in vivo. These results demonstrate that constraint-based modeling could be an 
important tool for the development of targeted microbiome-based therapies 
against human diseases.

BACKGROUND: Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the 
hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health 
risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of 
skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood.
METHODS: To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing 
NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic 
datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and 
human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA 
astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and 
skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4.
RESULTS: Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and 
mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health 
risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to 
determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While 
we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes 
associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also 
highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via 
post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.
CONCLUSION: Our findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures 
for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage.

Plain Language Summary: Spaceflight is a hostile environment which can lead to 
health problems in astronauts, including in the skin. It is not currently well 
understood why these skin problems occur. Here, we analyzed data from the skin 
of space flown mice and astronauts to try and identify possible explanations for 
these skin problems. It appears that changes in the activation of genes related 
to damage to DNA, skin barrier health, and mitochondria (the energy-producing 
parts of cells) may play a role in these skin problems. Further research will be 
needed to confirm exactly how these changes influence skin health, which could 
lead to solutions for preventing and managing such issues in astronauts.

In the wild, C. elegans are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable 
menagerie of microorganisms. The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a 
barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this 
study, we identify microbes from C. elegans natural habitats that associate with 
its cuticle, constituting a simple ""skin microbiome."" We rear our animals on a 
modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We 
first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro 
skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. elegans 
surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify 
relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon 
surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that 
some strains of bacteria, including Enterobacter sp. JUb101, are primarily found 
on the nematode skin, while others like Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and 
Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 are predominantly found in the animal's gut. Finally, 
we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh 
environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied 
nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in 
naturalized contexts.
IMPORTANCE: The genetic model organism C. elegans has recently emerged as a tool 
for understanding host-microbiome interactions. Nearly all of these studies 
either focus on pathogenic or gut-resident microbes. Little is known about the 
existence of native, nonpathogenic skin microbes or their function. We 
demonstrate that members of a modified C. elegans model microbiome, mCeMbio, can 
adhere to the animal's cuticle and confer protection from noxious environments. 
We combine a novel micro-swab tool, the first 16S microbial sequencing data from 
relatively unperturbed C. elegans, and physiological assays to demonstrate 
microbially mediated protection of the skin. This work serves as a foundation to 
explore wild C. elegans skin microbiomes and use C. elegans as a model for skin 
research.

UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization 
and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and 
PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase 
expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine 
to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres 
and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented 
mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA 
mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of 
electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I 
and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. 
This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting 
from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest 
signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements 
with energy production.

The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing 
technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection 
of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an 
expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid 
and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a 
function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR 
propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing 
and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, 
diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. 
Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of 
both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial 
pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, 
arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions 
that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of 
PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of 
pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of 
spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that 
housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, 
robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom 
environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive 
effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, 
and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.

Mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies 
have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and 
improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut 
microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c 
mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the 
wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice 
controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut 
communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly 
different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness 
in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a 
general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the 
typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured 
immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar 
spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and 
spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice 
during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen 
load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB 
immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute 
infection better than LabC mice.

BACKGROUND: The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment 
due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide 
levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the 
composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development 
of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to 
characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second 
objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms 
associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS 
environment.
RESULTS: Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide-quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 
16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity 
and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical 
analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and 
Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. 
Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least 
abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial 
populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment 
did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) 
associated with each sampling site.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific 
human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS 
microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, 
Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus 
(Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total 
bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future 
studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present 
results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and 
population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify 
sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results 
will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements 
on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.

The on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space 
Station (ISS) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be 
affected by the distinct environment of the ISS. The low-nutrient environment 
combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the 
molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance 
of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, 
ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of 
the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to well-studied 
clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in 
the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. 
Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved 
in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most 
abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA 
and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, 
respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic 
pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin. This report provides insight into possible 
molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment.

BACKGROUND: An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH), simulated closed 
system isolated by HEPA filtration, mimics International Space Station (ISS) 
conditions and future human habitation on other planets except for the exchange 
of air between outdoor and indoor environments. The ILMAH was primarily 
commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological 
characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for 
other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and 
understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high 
importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also 
deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of 
human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew 
health in a future closed habitat.
RESULTS: Succession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and 
state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the 
ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to 
observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and 
opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, 
potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed 
spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the 
community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various 
locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA 
intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a 
significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated 
samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure 
changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the 
occupation time. Samples collected at day 20 showed distinct fungal profiles 
from samples collected at any other time point (before or after). Viable fungal 
families like Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales, and 
Pleosporaceae were shown to increase during the occupation time.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal 
diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is 
crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating 
and keep it safe for its inhabitants. Differences in community profiles were 
observed when statistically treated, especially of the mycobiome of samples 
collected at day 20. On a genus level Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, 
Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation 
time.

While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial 
diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise 
within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted 
using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an 
isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and 
longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial 
isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we 
profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and 
biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which 
represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and 
life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive 
behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the 
ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic 
characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial 
risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.

Microbiome analyses of low-biomass samples are challenging because of 
contamination and inefficiencies, leading many investigators to employ 
low-throughput methods with minimal controls. We developed a new automated 
protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos [clean]), that outperforms 
single-tube extractions while processing at least five times as fast. KatharoSeq 
incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial 
community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly identifies 90.6% 
(standard error, 0.013%) of the reads from 500 cells. To demonstrate the broad 
utility of KatharoSeq, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome 
analyses of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft assembly facility (SAF; n = 
192, 96), 52 rooms of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; n = 388, 337), and 
an endangered-abalone-rearing facility (n = 192, 123), obtaining spatially 
resolved, unique microbiomes reproducible across hundreds of samples. The SAF, 
our primary focus, contains 32 sOTUs (sub-OTUs, defined as exact sequence 
matches) and their inferred variants identified by the deblur algorithm, with 
four (Acinetobacter lwoffii, Paracoccus marcusii, Mycobacterium sp., and 
Novosphingobium) being present in >75% of the samples. According to microbial 
spatial topography, the most abundant cleanroom contaminant, A. lwoffii, is 
related to human foot traffic exposure. In the NICU, we have been able to 
discriminate environmental exposure related to patient infectious disease, and 
in the abalone facility, we show that microbial communities reflect the marine 
environment rather than human input. Consequently, we demonstrate the 
feasibility and utility of large-scale, low-biomass metagenomic analyses using 
the KatharoSeq protocol. IMPORTANCE Various indoor, outdoor, and host-associated 
environments contain small quantities of microbial biomass and represent a niche 
that is often understudied because of technical constraints. Many studies that 
attempt to evaluate these low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with 
erroneous results that are typically false positive signals obtained during the 
sampling process. We have investigated various low-biomass kits and methods to 
determine the limit of detection of these pipelines. Here we present KatharoSeq, 
a high-throughput protocol combining laboratory and bioinformatic methods that 
can differentiate a true positive signal in samples with as few as 50 to 500 
cells. We demonstrate the application of this method in three unique low-biomass 
environments, including a SAF, a hospital NICU, and an abalone-rearing facility.

BACKGROUND: The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built 
environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or 
from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The 
Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface 
study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome 
amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces 
over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to 
continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same 
locations, over another 14 months.
METHODS: Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and 
processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and 
controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable 
cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free 
DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated 
and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were 
cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results.
RESULTS: Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented 
bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface 
microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. 
Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant 
temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS 
antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with 
no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine 
antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with 
macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. 
Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 
82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for 
amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses 
showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis 
showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 105 cfu/m2 CONCLUSIONS: 
Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a 
comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, 
bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and 
resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and 
microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may 
help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface 
microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity. Video

Secondary metabolite (SM) production in Aspergillus niger JSC-093350089, 
isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a 
comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. The analysis 
revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones and therapeutically 
relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the 
antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for 
increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings 
include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA, which encodes a 
developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation 
of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed in A. 
niger, which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene, pyrE, in 
its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of 
pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate.

BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple 
drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence 
and pathogenic properties of five Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from 
the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes 
of three clinical strains. Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were 
characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. 
In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence 
typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar 
diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The 
draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid 
Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream 
analysis.
RESULTS: Molecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with 
all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. 
bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates 
(153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. 
bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with 
carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), 
protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments 
(275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In 
addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, 
disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic 
compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS 
strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding 
MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including 
upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli 
K12, was also observed in the ISS strains.
CONCLUSION: Given the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and 
increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% 
probability), these species pose important health considerations for future 
missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can 
help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but 
analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the influence of 
microgravity on their pathogenicity.

The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization 
of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the 
International Space Station (ISS) is reported. The investigation included the A. 
nidulans wild-type and three mutant strains, two of which were genetically 
engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing 
revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. 
In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite 
global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. 
Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate 
metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. 
ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the 
wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, 
which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable 
insights into the adaptation mechanism of A. nidulans to spacecraft 
environments.

The on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space 
Station (ISS) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be 
affected by the distinct environment of the ISS. The low-nutrient environment 
combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the 
molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance 
of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, 
ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of 
the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to well-studied 
clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in 
the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. 
Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved 
in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most 
abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA 
and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, 
respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic 
pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin. This report provides insight into possible 
molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment.

Two isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, ISS-F3 and ISS-F4, were cultured from the 
dining table on the International Space Station (ISS). Genomic analyses using 
EF-1α sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and 
single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically 
different from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that 
ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a 
non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a 
clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates 
that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. 
While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant 
pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans 
model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent 
opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans. However, its effects on 
the health of immunocompromised humans warrant further study. IMPORTANCE This is 
the first study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates from a built 
environment, as well as one that has been exposed to space. The characterization 
and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for the 
medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew 
who coinhabit the ISS with these strains.

BACKGROUND: The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited 
by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that 
are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, 
mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space 
stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is 
known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully 
appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, 
molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on 
ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three 
flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth.
RESULTS: The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 104 to 109 
CFU/m2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (Actinobacteria, 
Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. 
Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the 
culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal 
phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed 
over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over 
time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between 
samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community 
composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting 
that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, 
approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could 
be cultured.
CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on 
ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between 
locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and 
may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive 
catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in 
closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet 
NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can 
have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built 
environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and 
medical industries.

Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear 
power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to 
their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive 
in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of 
fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars 
conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and 
ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in 
strain-dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, 
ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, were further characterized for proteomic, and 
metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome 
biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No 
significant metabolome alterations were revealed. Lastly, ISSFT-021-30 conidia 
re-exposed to UV-C exhibited enhanced UV-C resistance when compared to the 
conidia of unexposed ISSFT-021.

Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are 
an important class of natural products that contain antibiotics and a variety of 
other bioactive compounds. The existing methods for discovery of RiPPs by 
combining genome mining and computational mass spectrometry are limited to 
discovering specific classes of RiPPs from small datasets, and these methods 
fail to handle unknown post-translational modifications. Here, we present 
MetaMiner, a software tool for addressing these challenges that is compatible 
with large-scale screening platforms for natural product discovery. After 
searching millions of spectra in the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) 
molecular networking infrastructure against just eight genomic and metagenomic 
datasets, MetaMiner discovered 31 known and seven unknown RiPPs from diverse 
microbial communities, including human microbiome and lichen microbiome, and 
microorganisms isolated from the International Space Station.

BACKGROUND: With increasing numbers of interplanetary missions, there is a need 
to establish robust protocols to ensure the protection of extraterrestrial 
planets being visited from contamination by terrestrial life forms. The current 
study is the first report comparing the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) 
microbiome with the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome to understand 
the risks of contamination, thus serving as a model system for future planetary 
missions.
RESULTS: Samples obtained from the internal surfaces and ground support 
equipment of three CRV missions were subjected to various molecular techniques 
for microbial diversity analysis. In total, 25 samples were collected with eight 
defined locations from each CRV mission prior to launch. In general, the 
internal surfaces of vehicles were clean, with an order of magnitude fewer 
microbes compared to ground support equipment. The first CRV mission had a 
larger microbial population than subsequent CRV missions, which were clean as 
compared to the initial CRV locations sampled. Cultivation assays showed the 
presence of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes and 
members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. As expected, shotgun metagenome 
analyses revealed the presence of more microbial taxa compared to 
cultivation-based assays. The internal locations of the CRV microbiome 
reportedly showed the presence of microorganisms capable of tolerating 
ultraviolet radiation (e.g., Bacillus firmus) and clustered separately from the 
ISS microbiome.
CONCLUSIONS: The metagenome sequence comparison of the CRV microbiome with the 
ISS microbiome revealed significant differences showing that CRV microbiomes 
were a negligible part of the ISS environmental microbiome. These findings 
suggest that the maintenance protocols in cleaning CRV surfaces are highly 
effective in controlling the contaminating microbial population during cargo 
transfer to the ISS via the CRV route.

Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from 
different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two 
consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, 
rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as 
IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as 
Methylorubrum rhodesianum. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, 
designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes 
and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum 
SE2.11T. Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS 
strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) 
values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization 
(dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on 
the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel 
species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 
100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three 
ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, 
belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally 
at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. 
Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae 
since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to 
other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty 
acid produced by the ISS strains are C18 : 1-ω7c and C18 : 1-ω6c. The 
predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were 
diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, 
phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, 
phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2T, 
IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus 
Methylobacterium, and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. 
The type strain is IF7SW-B2T (NRRL B-65601T and LMG 32165T).

Most natural populations are genetically diverse. Understanding how diversity is 
maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the 
potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity 
aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many 
studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as 
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly 
important for advancing our understanding of local adaptive processes and 
host-parasite interactions. Here, we review the emerging work and theory 
exploring the geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in the wild and 
how they are shaped by selective and demographic processes. We discuss patterns 
of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the 
context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. We 
emphasize how MHC diversity is often lower at the edges of species 
distributions, particularly in high-latitude and high-altitude regions. We also 
discuss MHC diversity in natural populations facing climate change. As climate 
change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic 
diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their 
resilience and long-term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic 
diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow 
biologists to test hypotheses regarding host-parasite coevolution and develop 
effective measures for conservation.

Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable 
polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at 
the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of 
extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer 
space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, 
are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting 
black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were 
exposed to simulated microgravity-one of the prevalent features characterizing 
space conditions-by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). 
Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia 
and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell 
physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to 
ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. 
Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and 
lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation 
via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant 
activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for 
the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of 
dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the 
secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in 
protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several

Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to 
LSSMG. Similarly, the strains' survivability was not negatively affected. This 
study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in 
black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.

Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as 
they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological 
benefits. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical 
role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a 
methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of 
red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space 
Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host-microbe 
total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. 
Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be 
an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional 
activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics 
of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the 
transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and 
maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.

Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of 
astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological 
processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also 
differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial 
investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 
3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in 
space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the 
gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological 
biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) 
group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on 
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted 
metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group 
mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum 
metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we 
have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and 
the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid 
metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group 
mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including 
neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close 
relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain 
dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut 
microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant 
(FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical 
differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest 
that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn 
triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, 
through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that 
valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key 
metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, 
disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or 
functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant 
practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability 
of living organisms in the space environment.

In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space 
Station (ISS), several Sphingomonas strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA 
gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as Sphingomonas 
sanguinis (n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center 
cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as 
Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS 
locations identified 23 Sphingomonas species. An abundance of shotgun 
metagenomic reads were detected for S. sanguinis in the location from where the 
ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated 
from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome 
sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates revealed that they were highly 
similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these Sphingomonas strains 
were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can 
potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of 
these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp. LK11, an arid desert 
strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones 
and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, 
indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, 
metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the S. 
sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to 
promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, 
heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to 
be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. 
Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the 
ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of 
self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. IMPORTANCESphingomonas 
is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme 
environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have been identified as 
potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the 
isolation and identification of Sphingomonas members from the ISS, which are 
capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production 
of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth 
orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone 
production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal 
resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, 
rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for 
biotechnology-related applications.

Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated 
from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These 
strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology 
when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions. 
Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct 
morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard 
Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, 
altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, 
budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus 
sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in 
the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens. The name 
Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1T 
as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, 
microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of 
phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. 
Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, 
and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a 
set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest 
molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule 
motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and 
succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the 
dominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the interactions between the 
various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be 
clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict 
possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on 
its organization.
RESULTS: Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, 
and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated 
several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These complementary approaches 
provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present 
amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and 
keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is 
beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the 
Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often 
found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the 
ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and 
amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, 
respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus 
fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. 
pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus. The electron 
micrography revealed that the presence of K. pneumoniae compromised the 
morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm-forming structures.
CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the importance of K. pneumoniae in the ISS, 
and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, 
including potential pathogens. This integrated modeling approach, combined with 
experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of 
other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies.

Microbial Burden Estimation of Food Items, Built Environments, and the 
International Space Station Using Film Media.

The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and 
incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past 
studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional 
agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes 
similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for 
cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean 
rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies 
is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water 
cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future 
applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable 
microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in 
three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth 
(homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station 
(ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with 
traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were 
compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments 
on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for 
bacterial counts, with R2 values of 0.94-0.96. Fungal counts for 
built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, 
with R2 values of 0.72-0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below 
detection to 103 CFU per 100 cm2, had R2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 
0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the 
detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal 
species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. 
film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed 
to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media 
such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for 
low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands 
tested in this study performed equally well.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring the adaptation of microorganisms to the extreme 
environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is crucial to understanding 
microbial evolution and infection prevention. Acinetobacter pittii is an 
opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, primarily impacting immunocompromised 
patients, that was recently isolated from two missions aboard the ISS.
RESULTS: Here, we report how ISS-associated A. pittii (n = 20 genomes) has 
formed its own genetically and functionally discrete clade distinct from most 
Earth-bound isolates (n = 291 genomes). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains 
acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum 
cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic 
analysis of resistance genes. By investigating 402 longitudinal environmental 
and host-associated ISS metagenomes, we observed that viable A. pittii is 
increasing in relative abundance and therefore potentially exhibiting 
succession, being identified in >2X more metagenomic samples in back-to-back 
missions. ISS strains additionally contain functions that enable them to survive 
in harsh environments, including the transcriptional regulator LexA. Via a 
genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden 
in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related 
Earth strains.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicated a step forward in understanding 
how microorganisms might evolve and alter their antibiotic resistance phenotype 
in extreme, resource-limited, human-built environments. Video Abstract.

BACKGROUND: Several investigations on the microbial diversity and functional 
properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out 
to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial 
population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet 
to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including 
phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial 
resistance, and virulence characteristics.
RESULTS: In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, 
in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 
MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel 
genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel bacterial species 
(Methylobacterium ajmalii). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; 
this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. 
Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. 
The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell 
wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in 
the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs 
were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 
2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, 
AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates 
and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes 
were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been 
predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze 
if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have 
variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related 
ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the 
variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The 
Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella 
strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed 
genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under 
microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here 
on Earth. Video Abstract.

A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall 
behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station 
(ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This 
strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, 
catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as 
F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with 
C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant 
tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain 
F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, 
while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella 
genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide 
identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described 
Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for 
strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 
(10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given 
the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species 
within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, 
with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no 
closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the 
whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. 
ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. 
rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella 
strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any 
other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. 
nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain 
F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.

The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed 
environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, 
including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's 
adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that 
it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented 
spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper 
understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed 
light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In 
this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver 
a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved 
from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 
demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing 
evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we 
characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which harbored 
genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin 
possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic 
element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella 
pneumoniae isolate of the ""high-risk"" ST101 clone. Our work provides insights 
into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, 
highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential 
pathogenic bacteria in such environments.

With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, 
understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs 
from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space 
conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series 
has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for 
almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of 
Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three 
non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the 
ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities 
with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their 
phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all 
strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, 
which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. 
Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values, when 
compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for 
all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, 
polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate 
phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun 
metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were 
isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, 
supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. 
In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino 
acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, 
prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these 
ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes 
associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of 
these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and 
enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH 
analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six 
strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. 
Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six 
ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: 
Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM 115933T), Leifsonia 
virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (= NRRL B-65661T = DSM 115931T), Leifsonia williamsii 
F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 115932T), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT 
(= NRRL B-65663T = DSM 115940T), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T 
(= NRRL B-65664T = DSM 115943T). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and 
phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in 
this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant 
microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species 
composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to 
human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space 
habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step 
towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.

BACKGROUND: The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human 
achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, 
characterised by microgravity, increased CO 2 levels, and elevated solar 
radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants 
play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts 
on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is 
Enterobacter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the 
human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, 
leading to a plethora of infections.
RESULTS: Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have 
exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen 
group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to 
antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 
strains of multidrug-resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various 
locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to 
understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison 
to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical 
infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, 
especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential 
antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the 
singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on 
Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, 
we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of E. bugandensis across 
the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the 
persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of 
E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical 
techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting 
microbial communities alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple 
missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial 
interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the 
ISS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these 
interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might 
contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within 
the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, 
they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, 
isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive 
measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks 
associated with potential pathogenic threats. Video Abstract.

BACKGROUND: The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) 
puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 
20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such 
pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound 
relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.
RESULTS: In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of 
five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are 
non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a 
deep-learning based tool-deepFRI-we were able to functionally annotate close to 
100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation 
tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across 
all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS 
microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing 
similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, 
including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via 
mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract 
heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements 
enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain 
genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small 
molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, 
exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports 
explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced 
antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we 
studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel 
proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel 
S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse 
microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the 
microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment 
may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space 
missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose 
health risks. Video Abstract.

In secondary metabolite biosynthesis, core synthetic genes such as polyketide 
synthase genes usually encode proteins that generate various backbone 
precursors. These precursors are modified by other tailoring enzymes to yield a 
large variety of different secondary metabolites. The number of core synthesis 
genes in a given species correlates, therefore, with the number of types of 
secondary metabolites the organism can produce. In our study, heterologous 
expression of all the A. terreus NRPS-like genes showed that two NRPS-like 
proteins, encoded by atmelA and apvA, release the same natural product, 
aspulvinone E. In hyphae this compound is converted to aspulvinones whereas in 
conidia it is converted to melanin. The genes are expressed in different tissues 
and this spatial control is probably regulated by their own specific promoters. 
Comparative genomics indicates that atmelA and apvA might share a same ancestral 
gene and the gene apvA is located in a highly conserved region in Aspergillus 
species that contains genes coding for life-essential proteins. Our data reveal 
the first case in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in which the tissue specific 
production of a single compound directs it into two separate pathways, producing 
distinct compounds with different functions. Our data also reveal that a single 
trans-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and 
butyrolactones, revealing that genes outside of contiguous secondary metabolism 
gene clusters can modify more than one compound thereby expanding metabolite 
diversity. Our study raises the possibility of incorporation of spatial, 
cell-type specificity in expression of secondary metabolites of biological 
interest and provides new insight into designing and reconstituting their 
biosynthetic pathways.

Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse 
bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing 
has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs 
than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are 
either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. 
There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link 
them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these ""cryptic"" 
pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an 
understanding of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield 
optimization of first-generation molecules and genetic engineering of 
second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs 
produced by Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and 
Aspergillus terreus in the past six years (2012-2018). Genetic identification 
and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with 
proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk 
of vertebral compression fracture. While bone is typically considered radiation 
resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT. The goal of 
this work was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae 
after irradiation. Sixteen male rhesus macaque non-human primates (NHPs) were 
analyzed after whole-chest irradiation to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at the 
time of exposure varied from 45-134 months. Computed tomography (CT) scans were 
taken 2 months prior to irradiation and 2, 4, 6 and 8 months postirradiation for 
all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness were calculated 
longitudinally for thoracic (T) 9, lumbar (L) 2 and L4 vertebral bodies; gross 
morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality 
(related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs <50 months at time of exposure 
versus NHPs >50 months ( P = 0.03). Animals older than 50 months at time of 
exposure lost cortical thickness in T9 by 2 months postirradiation ( P = 
0.0009), which persisted to 8 months. In contrast, no loss of cortical thickness 
was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 
4 months postirradiation for T9, and 6 months postirradiation for L2 and L4 ( P 
< 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 months at time of exposure, both cortical 
thickness and BMD decreased in T9, L2 and L4 by 2 months postirradiation ( P < 
0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as 
determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid 
loss of cortical thickness was observed after high-dose chest irradiation in 
NHPs. Younger age at time of exposure was associated with increased 
pneumonitis-related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and cortical 
thickness at both in- and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid 
loss of BMD and cortical thickness from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD 
in out-of-field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high-dose radiation, and rapid 
loss of bone structure and density increases the risk of fractures.

Reduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight 
have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards 
combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly 
with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual 
and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) and reduced weight 
bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints. C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were 
either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading (HLU) or remained full-weight 
bearing (ground). On day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 Gy 
(sham), 0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy (n = 10/group), yielding eight groups: 
ground-sham; ground-0.1 Gy; ground-0.5 Gy; ground-1.0 Gy; HLU-sham; HLU-0.1 Gy; 
HLU-0.5 Gy; and HLU-1.0 Gy. On day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum 
were collected from the mice. Significant differences were identified 
statistically between treatment groups and the ground-sham control group, but no 
significant differences were observed between HLU and/or radiation groups. 
Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (microCECT) demonstrated decrease in 
volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage 
contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen 
was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage 
oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage 
degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to 
ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining 
the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a 
decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our 
findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to 
spaceflight relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee 
and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early 
administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active 
catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation. Further research is 
warranted with a focus on the prevention of cartilage degradation from long-term 
periods of reduced weight bearing and spaceflight-relevant low doses and 
qualities of radiation.

Both microgravity and radiation exposure in the spaceflight environment have 
been identified as hazards to astronaut health and performance. Substantial 
study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with 
prolonged exposure to microgravity, and the hazards presented by radiation from 
galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPEs) outside of low earth 
orbit (LEO). To date, the majority of the ground-based analogues (e.g., rodent 
or cell culture studies) that investigate the biology of and risks associated 
with spaceflight hazards will focus on an individual hazard in isolation. 
However, astronauts will face these challenges simultaneously Combined hazard 
studies are necessary for understanding the risks astronauts face as they travel 
outside of LEO, and are also critical for countermeasure development. The focus 
of this review is to describe biologic and functional outcomes from ground-based 
analogue models for microgravity and radiation, specifically highlighting the 
combined effects of radiation and reduced weight-bearing from rodent 
ground-based tail suspension via hind limb unloading (HLU) and partial 
weight-bearing (PWB) models, although in vitro and spaceflight results are 
discussed as appropriate. The review focuses on the skeletal, ocular, central 
nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and stem cells responses.

Reduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are 
associated with cartilage degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. 
Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb unloading (HLU) represent unique 
opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated arthritic changes 
in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee 
after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full 
weight-bearing. Cartilage and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via 
microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on 
the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the Space Shuttle 
Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing 
readaptation with/without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU 
occurred at similar spatial locations, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage 
contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal 
glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated 
catabolic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative 
stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses in menisci. After the 13-day 
Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed. During readaptation, recovery 
of cartilage volume and thickness occurred with exercise. Reduced weight-bearing 
from either spaceflight or HLU induced an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and 
menisci, and exercise promoted recovery.

Alpha(α)Klotho, a soluble transmembrane protein, facilitates calcium-phosphorus 
homeostasis through feedback between bone and kidney and is a potential systemic 
biomarker for bone-kidney health during spaceflight. We determined if: (1) 
plasma αKlotho was reduced after both spaceflight aboard the ISS and hindlimb 
unloading (HU); and (2) deficiency could be reversed with exercise. Both 
spaceflight and HU lowered circulating plasma αKlotho: plasma αKlotho recovered

Particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a human lung carcinogen and a human 
health concern. The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered 
to be a driving mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Homologous 
recombination repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, due to 
its highly accurate repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks. However, 
recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous recombination repair 
through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR repair 
that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show 
prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, 
causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is 
crucial to its function, this study investigated the effect of Cr(VI) on the 
RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute (24h) Cr(VI) 
exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, 
prolonged (120h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both 
proteins, although RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results 
correlate temporally with the previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 
cytoplasmic accumulation. In addition, we found Cr(VI) does not inhibit 
interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. Altogether, our 
results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, 
and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of 
RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its 
carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor 
proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.

In space, living organisms are exposed to multiple stress factors including 
microgravity and space radiation. For humans, these harmful environmental 
factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as bone loss and 
immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts 
human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately 
assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing 
effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been 
conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in 
cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways 
affected by spaceflight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space 
environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-κB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types 
under the true or simulated spaceflight conditions. NF-κB is of particular 
interest, as it is associated with many of the spaceflight-related health 
consequences. This review intends to summarize the transcriptomics studies that 
identified NF-κB as a responsive pathway to ground-based simulated microgravity 
or the true spaceflight condition. These studies were carried out using either 
human cell or animal models. In addition, the review summarizes the studies that 
focused specifically on NF-κB pathway in specific cell types or organ tissues as 
related to the known spaceflight-related health risks including immune 
dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, central nerve system (CNS) dysfunction, 
and risks associated with space radiation. Whether the NF-κB pathway is 
activated or inhibited in space is dependent on the cell type, but the potential 
health impact appeared to be always negative. It is argued that more studies on 
NF-κB should be conducted to fully understand this particular pathway for the 
benefit of crew health in space.

In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and 
space radiation, pose constant threat to the DNA integrity of living organisms. 
Specifically, space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly, through the 
interaction of charged particles with the DNA molecules themselves, or 
indirectly through the production of free radicals. Although organisms have 
evolved strategies on Earth to confront such damage, space environmental 
conditions, especially microgravity, can impact DNA repair resulting in 
accumulation of severe DNA lesions. Ultimately these lesions, namely double 
strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronucleus formation, or mutations, can 
increase the risk for adverse health effects, such as cancer. How spaceflight 
factors affect DNA damage and the DNA damage response has been investigated 
since the early days of the human space program. Over the years, these 
experiments have been conducted either in space or using ground-based analogs. 
This review summarizes the evidence for DNA damage induction by space radiation 
and/or microgravity as well as spaceflight-related impacts on the DNA damage 
response. The review also discusses the conflicting results from studies aimed 
at addressing the question of potential synergies between microgravity and 
radiation with regard to DNA damage and cellular repair processes. We conclude 
that further experiments need to be performed in the true space environment in 
order to address this critical question.

The implementation of rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) for studying the effect of 
lack of gravity has attracted attention, especially in the fields of stem cells, 
tissue regeneration, and cancer research. Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit 
several features of immunosuppression including impaired leukocyte 
proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, 
stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, 
such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These 
pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, 
pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in 
regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic 
system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic 
effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity 
in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated 
with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, 
and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant 
synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene 
(ADRB2). Radiation alone increased ADRB2 expression, and cells incubated in 
microgravity had more DNA strand breaks than cells incubated in normal gravity. 
We observed radiation-induced cytokine production only in microgravity. Prior 
treatment with isoproterenol clearly prevents most of the microgravity-mediated 
effects. RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory 
pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients 
suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.

Tissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and 
protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is 
not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium 
and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid 
nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both 
RNA and proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS 
analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a 
transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene 
transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to 
be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). This response 
is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 
108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold 
change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological 
information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and 
proteomic experiments.

BACKGROUND: Understanding of gravity sensing and response is critical to 
long-term human habitation in space and can provide new advantages for 
terrestrial agriculture. To this end, the altered gene expression profile 
induced by microgravity has been repeatedly queried by microarray and RNA-seq 
experiments to understand gravitropism. However, the quantification of altered 
protein abundance in space has been minimally investigated.
RESULTS: Proteomic (iTRAQ-labelled LC-MS/MS) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) 
analyses simultaneously quantified protein and transcript differential 
expression of three-day old, etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown 
aboard the International Space Station along with their ground control 
counterparts. Protein extracts were fractionated to isolate soluble and membrane 
proteins and analyzed to detect differentially phosphorylated peptides. In 
total, 968 RNAs, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified 
as differentially expressed. In addition, the proteomic analyses identified 16 
differential phosphorylation events. Proteomic data delivered novel insights and 
simultaneously provided new context to previously made observations of gene 
expression in microgravity. There is a sweeping shift in post-transcriptional 
mechanisms of gene regulation including RNA-decapping protein DCP5, the splicing 
factors GRP7 and GRP8, and AGO4,. These data also indicate AHA2 and FERONIA as 
well as CESA1 and SHOU4 as central to the cell wall adaptations seen in 
spaceflight. Patterns of tubulin-α 1, 3,4 and 6 phosphorylation further reveal 
an interaction of microtubule and redox homeostasis that mirrors osmotic 
response signaling elements. The absence of gravity also results in a seemingly 
wasteful dysregulation of plastid gene transcription.
CONCLUSIONS: The datasets gathered from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to 
microgravity revealed marked impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell 
wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. The 
impact of post-transcriptional regulatory alterations represents an unstudied 
element of the plant microgravity response with the potential to significantly 
impact plant growth efficiency and beyond. What's more, addressing the effects 
of microgravity on AHA2, CESA1, and alpha tubulins has the potential to enhance 
cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing biomass 
production and growth in microgravity. Finally, understanding and manipulating 
the dysregulation of plastid gene transcription has further potential to address 
the goal of enhancing plant growth in the stressful conditions of microgravity.

With the construction of the International Space Station, humans have been 
continuously living and working in space for 22 years. Microbial studies in 
space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for 
bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to ""normal"" conditions. Some of 
these changes, like biofilm formation, can impact astronaut health and 
spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for 
plastic degradation, can promote self-sufficiency and sustainability in space. 
With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions 
to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research 
into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring 
success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome 
studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone 
deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that 
incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and 
establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this 
review, information will be presented on the beneficial use of microbes in 
bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their 
capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications. 
In addition, we discuss the negative effect microbes and microbial communities 
may have on long-duration space travel and provide mitigation strategies to 
reduce their impact. Utilizing the benefits of microbes, while understanding 
their limitations, will help us explore deeper into space and develop 
sustainable human habitats on the Moon, Mars and beyond.

Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial 
resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is 
relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth-orbit, 
but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space 
waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose 
and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish 
sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. 
Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will 
be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental 
issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial 
diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise 
within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted 
using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an 
isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and 
longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial 
isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we 
profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and 
biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which 
represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and 
life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive 
behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the 
ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic 
characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial 
risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.

Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind 
since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that 
humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending 
astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space 
Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts 
are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that 
astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. 
Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor 
astronauts' health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation 
patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the 
publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 
differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that 
space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire 
genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically 
developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts' 
health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, 
are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is 
negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the 
alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that 
frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of 
this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled 
outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled 
lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its 
proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we 
screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and 
identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein 
encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5-dependent mucoidy 
occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or 
MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a 
region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in 
vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA 
in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism 
for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its 
ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide 
signals.

It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of 
burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global 
injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of ""toxic lymph"" 
following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic 
space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a 
single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. 
We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in 
lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated 
burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and 
observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic 
endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII+ immune 
cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed 
significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic 
endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. 
Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, 
whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic 
endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in 
doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells 
already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the 
lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce 
lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic 
injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations 
along the vessel.

Space experiments are a technically challenging but a scientifically important 
part of astrobiology and astrochemistry research. The International Space 
Station (ISS) is an excellent example of a highly successful and long-lasting 
research platform for experiments in space, that has provided a wealth of 
scientific data over the last two decades. However, future space platforms 
present new opportunities to conduct experiments with the potential to address 
key topics in astrobiology and astrochemistry. In this perspective, the European 
Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry (with feedback 
from the wider scientific community) identifies a number of key topics and 
summarizes the 2021 ""ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper"" for 
astrobiology and astrochemistry. We highlight recommendations for the 
development and implementation of future experiments, discuss types of in situ 
measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios and orbits, and 
identify knowledge gaps and how to advance scientific utilization of future 
space-exposure platforms that are either currently under development or in an 
advanced planning stage. In addition to the ISS, these platforms include 
CubeSats and SmallSats, as well as larger platforms such as the Lunar Orbital 
Gateway. We also provide an outlook for in situ experiments on the Moon and 
Mars, and welcome new possibilities to support the search for exoplanets and 
potential biosignatures within and beyond our solar system.

As we aim to expand human presence in space, we need to find viable approaches 
to achieve independence from terrestrial resources. Space biomining of the Moon, 
Mars and asteroids has been indicated as one of the promising approaches to 
achieve in-situ resource utilization by the main space agencies. Structural and 
expensive metals, essential mineral nutrients, water, oxygen and volatiles could 
be potentially extracted from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks using 
microbial-based biotechnologies. The use of bioleaching microorganisms could 
also be applied to space bioremediation, recycling of waste and to reinforce 
regenerative life support systems. However, the science around space biomining 
is still young. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial 
conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a 
direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a 
possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and 
space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the 
effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our 
knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well 
as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to 
overcome limitations posed by the space environments.

Bacterial behavior has been studied under microgravity conditions, but very 
little is known about it under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes. An 
Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and 
an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed 
for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, 
phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three 
Escherichia coli strains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated 
micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. The results included increased growth 
under simulated micro- and lunar gravities for some strains, and higher 
concentrations of antibiotics needed under simulated lunar gravity with respect 
to simulated micro- and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be 
considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered 
gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation 
devices' ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space. 
Nevertheless, this approach serves as a baseline to start interrogating key 
cellular and molecular aspects relevant to microbial processes on the lunar and 
Martian surfaces.

The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft 
poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts' health. To 
mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms' 
behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. 
Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance 
as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) 
was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene 
expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less 
robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. 
Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making 
LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the 
different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm 
reduction on LIS are discussed.

A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide 
waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic 
compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic 
molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and 
carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light 
conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although 
there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in 
space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid 
agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that 
breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on 
the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures 
can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set 
required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive 
growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) 
mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at 
the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, 
which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to 
natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating 
positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA 
repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC 
transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal 
transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in 
this spaceflight production system.

The establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term 
deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and 
psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and 
performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving 
simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie 
units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization 
using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from 
two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. 
'Outredgeous'); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf 
lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann's) and associated rooting pillow 
components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen 
screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples 
of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and 
fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 
16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant 
tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and 
rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable 
information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of 
the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.

One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth's 
magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) 
protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars 
explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both 
nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, 
the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been 
sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the 
effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and 
simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis 
thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [Brassica rapa var. japonica]. 
Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 
cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space 
Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control 
and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled 
environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were 
measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure 
to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated 
Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier 
ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and 
SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds 
exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In 
general, the extent of damage depends on the seed type.

AIMS: We investigate the bioremediation potential of the microbiome of the 
Gowanus Canal, a contaminated waterway in Brooklyn, NY, USA, designated a 
Superfund site by the US Environmental Protection Agency due to high 
concentrations of contaminants, including polychlorinated biphenyls, 
petrochemicals, and heavy metals.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a metagenomic analysis of the Gowanus Canal 
sediment, consisting of a longitudinal study of surface sediment and a 
depth-based study of sediment core samples. We demonstrate that the resident 
microbiome includes 455 species, including extremophiles across a range of 
saltwater and freshwater species, which collectively encode 64 metabolic 
pathways related to organic contaminant degradation and 1171 genes related to 
heavy metal utilization and detoxification. Furthermore, our genetic screening 
reveals an environmental reservoir of antimicrobial resistance markers falling 
within 8 different classes of resistance, as well as de-novo characterization of 
2319 biosynthetic gene clusters and diverse groups of secondary metabolites with 
biomining potential.
CONCLUSION: The microbiome of the Gowanus Canal is a biotechnological resource 
of novel metabolic functions that could aid in efforts for bioremediation, AMR 
reservoir mapping, and heavy metal mitigation.

Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust 
alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in 
vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and 
controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to 
characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting 
device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based 
sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, 
validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function 
under cytokine-induced inflammation. Our platform, capable of at least 1 μM 
resolution, tracked paracellular transport in situ for 9 days of culture under 
perfusion on-chip. These results offer an alternative sensing approach for 
continuous, non-invasive luminescence monitoring in OOCs.

Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are 
associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their 
mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the 
hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily 
associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in 
the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from 
mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment 
show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in 
the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the 
spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that 
space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not 
likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, 
spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head 
endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes 
premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal 
maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat 
during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in 
standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These 
findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological 
enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading 
of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results 
indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading 
of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while 
sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear 
unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal 
plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect 
that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.

Space flight exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, 
rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to 
determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were 
housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were 
launched to the ISS as part of NASA's Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 
CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. 
Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of 
inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) 
for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome 
activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when 
compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice 
corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of 
launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in 
the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, 
IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. 
Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the 
levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling 
in the brain of mice.

Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as 
NASA's Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space 
travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the 
cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to 
immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while 
on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus 
toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination 
in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart 
transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The 
results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation 
in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling 
pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and 
IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton 
and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative 
stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization 
in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the 
heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac 
alterations which can occur during spaceflight.

Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For 
example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown 
rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. 
Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which 
exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true 
correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning 
ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference 
Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a 
binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify 
genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic 
and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our 
approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous 
traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to 
play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, 
and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space 
travel.

Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, 
few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated 
the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old 
male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 
14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females 
after HLU versus control females (n = 6-8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in 
males (n = 5-6). Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and 
collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following 
HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the 
aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not 
altered in males. HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative 
stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER 
agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine without 
altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females (n = 4 in each group) suggesting that 
lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated 
microgravity. This study highlights sex-specific vascular adaptations to the 
state of simulated microgravity.

Space biology and health data are critical for the success of deep space 
missions and sustainable human presence off-world. At the core of effectively 
managing biomedical risks is the commitment to open science principles, which 
ensure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, reproducible 
and maximally open. The 2021 integration of the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive 
with GeneLab to establish the NASA Open Science Data Repository significantly 
enhanced access to a wide range of life sciences, biomedical-clinical and 
mission telemetry data alongside existing 'omics data from GeneLab. This paper 
describes the new database, its architecture and new data streams supporting 
diverse data types and enhancing data submission, retrieval and analysis. 
Features include the biological data management environment for improved data 
submission, a new user interface, controlled data access, an enhanced API and 
comprehensive public visualization tools for environmental telemetry, radiation 
dosimetry data and 'omics analyses. By fostering global collaboration through 
its analysis working groups and training programs, the open science data 
repository promotes widespread engagement in space biology, ensuring 
transparency and inclusivity in research. It supports the global scientific 
community in advancing our understanding of spaceflight's impact on biological 
systems, ensuring humans will thrive in future deep space missions.

The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts who spend 
time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight 
environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of 
centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity 
in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on 
the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) 
to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, 
and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal 
tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity 
environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina 
consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and 
lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the 
ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent 
manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate 
spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue.

Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic 
cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR 
particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily 
penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have 
shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, 
Varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during 
stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and 
the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular 
processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating 
latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs 
gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton 
ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the 
cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral 
genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the 
compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of 
transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic 
replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong 
contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization 
and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and 
PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase 
expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine 
to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres 
and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented 
mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA 
mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of 
electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I 
and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. 
This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting 
from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest 
signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements 
with energy production.

BACKGROUND: The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) 
puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 
20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such 
pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound 
relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.
RESULTS: In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of 
five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are 
non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a 
deep-learning based tool-deepFRI-we were able to functionally annotate close to 
100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation 
tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across 
all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS 
microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing 
similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, 
including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via 
mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract 
heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements 
enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain 
genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small 
molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, 
exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports 
explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced 
antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we 
studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel 
proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel 
S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse 
microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the 
microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment 
may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space 
missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose 
health risks. Video Abstract.

BACKGROUND: The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more 
people living and working in unique built environments similar to the 
International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that 
contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in 
these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from 
a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health 
outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for 
modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated 
relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community 
composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust 
from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with 
activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative 
humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 
4.4 × 106 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no 
exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 1010 when exposed to 100% relative 
humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal 
diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q < 0.05) and beta 
(R2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled 
using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change 
based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2 = 0.22, 
P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 
85% relative humidity (Q < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to 
develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard 
human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include 
other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon 
dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in 
spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft 
integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in 
low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond. Video Abstract.

The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of 
spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, 
insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological 
responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions 
during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota 
and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of 
spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 
microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate 
metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. 
Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid 
metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. 
Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy 
metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the 
host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these 
interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration 
spaceflight feasibility.

Stem cell research performed in space has provided fundamental insights into 
stem cell properties and behavior in microgravity including cell proliferation, 
differentiation, and regeneration capabilities. However, there is broader 
scientific value to this research including potential translation of stem cell 
research in space to clinical applications. Here, we present important 
discoveries from different studies performed in space demonstrating the 
potential use of human stem cells as well as the limitations in cellular 
therapeutics. A full understanding of the effects of microgravity in space on 
potentially supporting the expansion and/or enhancement of stem cell function is 
required to translate the findings into clinics.

Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against 
malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from 
astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity 
present during spaceflight affects the body's defenses against leukemogenesis. 
Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated 
microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) 
cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This 
brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, 
and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq 
performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into 
the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of 
space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against 
MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut 
risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.

Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in 
physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the 
absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to 
extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on 
cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac 
responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading 
(HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity 
and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered 
expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, 
we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months 
of age) Long-Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days 
and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in 
oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene 
expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed 
elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In 
nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and 
normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. 
RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 
days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory 
signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes 
associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these 
findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and 
that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of 
countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant 
skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly 
attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 
(SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage 
site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently 
demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of 
the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in 
reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. 
The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with 
the antioxidant, Manganese(III) 
meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), 
could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles 
from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the 
international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. 
Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly 
increased SERCA's ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content 
(marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In 
conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy 
and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work 
should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at 
increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak.
