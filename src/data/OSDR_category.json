To understand these consequences better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model to compare innate immune responses to bacteria and fungi in flies that were either raised on earth or in outer space aboard the NASA Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-121). Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression that occur in response to infection by bacteria and fungus in drosophila that were either hatched and raised in outer space (microgravity) or on earth (normal gravity). Whole Oregon R strain drosophila melanogaster fruit flies either raised on earth or in space that were (1) uninfected, (2) infected with bacteria (Escherichia coli), or (3) infected with fungus (Beauveria bassiana) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.",

      "description": "Gene expression levels were determined in 3rd instar and adult Drosophila melanogaster reared during spaceflight, to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms underpinning the effects of microgravity on the immune system. The goal was to validate the Drosophila model for understanding alterations of innate immune responses in humans due to spaceflight. Five containers of flies, with ten female and five male fruit flies in each container, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours, with a new generation reared in microgravity. RNA was extracted on the day of shuttle landing from whole body animals (3rd instar larvae and adults), hybridized to Drosophila 2.0 Affymetrix genome arrays, and the expression level of all genes was normalized against the gene expression level from the corresponding developmental stage animals raised on ground. Spaceflight altered the expression of larval genes involved in the maturation of plasmatocytes (macrophages) and their phagocytic response, as well as the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity. Larval microarrays (FL 6 samples) are based on RNA extracted from 6 independent sets of 50 mid 3rd instar larvae reared in microgravity and collected on the day of landing after 12 days and 18.5 hours on the space shuttle and the same number of control larvae raised on ground (GL 6 samples). Adults microarrays (F1 3 samples) are based on RNA from 3 sets of 20 adult females each, that emerged during spaceflight and within 4 hours of landing and the same number of adult females from the corresponding ground control containers (G1 3 samples).",

We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of space-flown thymic tissue and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. We report here microarray gene expression analysis in young adult C57BL/6NTac mice at 8 weeks of age after exposure to spaceflight aboard the space shuttle (STS-118) for a period of 13 days. Upon conclusion of the mission, thymus lobes were extracted from space flown mice (FLT) as well as age- and sex-matched ground control mice similarly housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM). mRNA was extracted and an automated array analysis for gene expression was performed. Examination of the microarray data revealed 970 individual probes that had a 1.5 fold or greater change. When these data were averaged (n equals 4), we identified 12 genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by at least 1.5 fold after spaceflight (p less than 0.05). Together, these data demonstrate that spaceflight induces significant changes in the thymic mRNA expression of genes that regulate stress, glucocorticoid receptor metabolism, and T cell signaling activity. These data explain, in part, the reported systemic compromise of the immune system after exposure to the microgravity of space.",

Three tissue types were examined (leaves, hypocotyls and roots) and compared to analyses conducted with whole plants. Transcriptome analyses with whole plants suggested that the spaceflight environment had little impact on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis, however, closer examination of selected tissues revealed that there are a number of tissue-specific responses that Arabidopsis employs to respond to this novel environment.",

Microarray analysis indicates that there are changes in overall gene expression of the cultured cells exposed to these unusual environments but also that gravitational and magnetic field produce synergic variations in the steady state of the transcriptional profile of A. thaliana. Significant changes in the expression of structural, abiotic stress and secondary metabolism genes were observed into the magnet field. These results confirm that the strong magnetic field, both at micro g* or 2g*, has a significant effect on the expression of these genes but subtle gravitational effects are still observable. These subtle responses to microgravity environments are opposite to the ones observed in a hypergravity one.",

Moreover, the effects of space flight on microbial pathogenicity and associated infectious disease risks have not been studied. The bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium was grown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-115 and compared with identical ground control cultures. Global microarray and proteomic analyses revealed that 167 transcripts and 73 proteins changed expression with the conserved RNA-binding protein Hfq identified as a likely global regulator involved in the response to this environment. Hfq involvement was confirmed with a ground-based microgravity culture model. Space flight samples exhibited enhanced virulence in a murine infection model and extracellular matrix accumulation consistent with a biofilm. Strategies to target Hfq and related regulators could potentially decrease infectious disease risks during space flight missions and provide novel therapeutic options on Earth.",

      "description": "The goal of this study was to assess whether low shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG) affects yeast genomic expression patterns using the powerful tool of whole genome microarray hybridization. We determined changes in the yeast model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisisae, when grown in LSMMG using the rotating High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV). A significant number of genes were up- or down-regulated by at least two fold in cells that were grown for 5 generations or 25 generations in HARVs. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling pathways containing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic cells to the external stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment. A comparison of the microgravity response to other environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond ,significantly to LSMMG are involved in a general environmental stress response, while 74% of the genes may represent a unique transcriptional response to microgravity. In addition, we found changes in genes involved in budding, cell polarity establishment, and cell separation that confirm our hypothesis that exposure to LSMMG causes changes in gene transcription resulting in a phenotypic response. The results of the study provide interesting clues to potential mechanisms involved in the response to, adaptation to, and survival of eukaryotic cells in a microgravity environment and our findings may have important health implications for human spaceflight.

      "description": "This study tested the hypothesis that transcription of immediate early genes is inhibited in T cells activated in microgravity (uG). Immunosuppression during spaceflight is a major barrier to safe long-term human space habitation and travel. The goals of these experiments were to prove that uG was the cause of impaired T cell activation during spaceflight as well as understand the mechanisms controlling early T cell activation. T cells from 4 human donors were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) and anti-CD28 onboard the International Space Station (ISS). An onboard centrifuge was used to generate a 1g simultaneous control to isolate the effects of uG from other variables of spaceflight. Microarray expression analysis after 1.5 hours of activation demonstrated that mg- and 1g-activated T cells had distinct patterns of global gene expression and identified 47 genes that were significantly differentially down-regulated in uG. Importantly, several key immediate early genes were inhibited in uG. T cells were isolated from human volunteers. T cells from each donor were kept separate and loaded into individual chambers in separate cassettes for the following treatments: uG non-activated, uG activated, and 1g activated. Therefore, samples represent biological triplicates. Experimental units were launched into space and placed into the KUBIK facility onboard the International Space Station. The 1g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied 1g force. The uG units were place in the static positions for continued uG exposure. After 30 minutes of pre-incubation, uG non-activated units were fixed by addition of RNALater (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), removed from the incubator, and stored in 4Â°C. The uG and 1g activated units were injected with final concentration 10mg/ml Con A and 4mg/ml anti-CD28. These cassettes were replaced into KUBIK on either the centrifuge or static positions and activated for 1.5 hours. Activation was stopped with the addition of RNALater and the units were then moved to 4Â°C storage. All units were returned to Earth for analysis.",

      "description": "Anticipating the risk for infectious disease during space exploration and habitation is a critical factor to ensure safety, health and performance of the crewmembers. As a ubiquitous environmental organism that is occasionally part of the human flora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa could pose a health hazard for the immuno-compromised astronauts. In order to gain insights in the behavior of P. aeruginosa in spaceflight conditions, two spaceflight-analogue culture systems, i.e. the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random position machine (RPM), were used. Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment of the RWV compared to the normal gravity control (NG), revealed a regulatory role for AlgU (RpoE). Specifically, P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG exhibited increased alginate production and up-regulation of AlgU-controlled transcripts, including those encoding stress-related proteins. This study also shows the involvement of Hfq in the LSMMG response, consistent with its previously identified role in the Salmonella LSMMG- and spaceflight response. Furthermore, cultivation in LSMMG increased heat and oxidative stress resistance and caused a decrease in the culture oxygen transfer rate. Interestingly, the global transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa grown in the RPM was similar to that in NG. The possible role of differences in fluid mixing between the RWV and RPM is discussed, with the overall collective data favoring the RWV as the optimal model to study the LSMMG-response of suspended cells. This study represents a first step towards the identification of specific virulence mechanisms of P. aeruginosa activated in response to spaceflight-analogue conditions, and could direct future research regarding the risk assessment and prevention of Pseudomonas infections for the crew in flight and the general public.",

      "description": "This study describes the transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to low-Earth orbit environmental conditions. Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa. To this end, P. aeruginosa cultures were grown in space, and the expression profile was compared with ground control samples (both in biological triplicate). Characterization of bacterial behavior in the microgravity environment of spaceflight is of importance towards risk assessment and prevention of infectious disease during long-term missions. Further, this research field unveils new insights into connections between low fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process in vivo, and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the global transcriptomic and proteomic response of an opportunistic pathogen that is actually found in the space habitat, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq identified as a global transcriptional regulator in the response to this environment. Since Hfq was also induced in spaceflight-grown Salmonella typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator across the bacterial species border. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight conditions were the lecA and lecB lectins and the rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), involved in the production of rhamnolipids. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data of this organism grown in microgravity-analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Interesting similarities were observed, among others with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen utilization. While LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was presumably most prominent. Differences in hardware between spaceflight and LSMMG experiments, in combination with more pronounced low fluid shear and mixing in spaceflight when compared to LSMMG conditions, were hypothesized to be at the origin of these observations. Collectively, our data suggest that spaceflight conditions could induce the transition of P. aeruginosa from an opportunistic organism to potential pathogen, results that are of importance for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and in the clinic.",

      "description": "We address a key baseline question of whether gene expression changes are induced by the orbital environment, and then we ask whether undifferentiated cells, cells presumably lacking the typical gravity response mechanisms, perceive spaceflight. Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April, 2010, as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold, and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast, cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response, with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression, a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity.",

      "description": "Microgravity leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study, we used NASA developed ground based Rotary Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWV), Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. Gene expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival, differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition, microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor, c-Fms and PLCy2 and S100A8 molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further, microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus, microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. Microgravity associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. Astronauts experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in RCCS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx Labs, Houston, TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. Data obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem, Inc.

Using tissue from these rats, we focused on the 3-week time point employing microarray analysis to identify what cellular processes or lack of processes could account for these observed deficiencies. We used the Affymetrix RG_U34A GeneChip and performed image analysis with Microarray Suite 5.0. For normalization we used the MAS global normalization protocol with a default target mean signal of 500. Gene expression in medial collateral ligament tissue under 4 different treatment conditions was measured: loaded control, loaded wound healing, unloaded control, and unloaded wound healing. From our results, it appears that unloaded tissue lags behind loaded tissue in its progression through the healing process and at 3 weeks is still engaged in the proliferative phase, whereas loaded tissue is actively remodeling its collagen matrix.",

      "title": "Candida albicans response to spaceflight (NASA STS-115)",
      "description": "This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 454 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.4% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, actin cytoskeleton, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed. This study represents an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public. Cells were grown for 24 hours on the space shuttle or as ground-based controls, preserved in RNALater, and stored at -80C. Four samples of each flight- and ground-based controls were harvested for microarray analysis. GAP is Group Activation Pack and each GAP contains 8 FPAs. The numbers represent the # assigned to the particular GAP and the number assigned to the specific FPA (1-8) within the indicated GAP. The same hardware is used for the flight samples and the ground samples.",

      "description": "Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial spores are considered likely potential forward contaminants on robotic missions to Mars. Thus it is important to understand their global responses to long-term exposure to space or Mars environments. As part of the PROTECT experiment, spores of B. subtilis 168 were exposed to real space conditions and to simulated martian conditions for 559 days in low Earth orbit mounted on the EXPOSE-E exposure platform outside the European Columbus module on the International Space Station. Upon return, spores were germinated, total RNA extracted and fluorescently labeled, and used to probe a custom Bacillus subtilis microarray to identify genes preferentially activated or repressed relative to ground control spores. Increased transcript levels were detected for a number of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response, SP-beta prophage induction), protein damage (CtsR/Clp system), oxidative stress (PerR regulon) and cell envelope stress (SigV regulon). Spores exposed to space demonstrated a much broader and more severe stress response than spores exposed to simulated Mars conditions. The results are discussed in the context of planetary protection for a hypothetical journey of potential forward contaminant spores from Earth to Mars and their subsequent residence on Mars. Two-color microarrays were performed comparing germination of Space-exposed or Mars-exposed vs. ground-control (Earth) spores.",

      "description": "In March 2006, murine Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSC) were flown in the Soyuz 12S to the International Space Station to investigate the effects of microgravity on their osteogenic potential in a three-dimensional environment. BMSC were grown in porous bioceramic Skelite disks (dia 9 mm x T 1.2 mm). The constructs were exposed to microgravity for ca. 8 days, then fixed for RNA extraction. While the flight experiment was performed in fully automated hardware inside the KUBIK incubator, one group of control samples were incubated inside manually operated hardwares (flight control), and the other control group was incubated under routine laboratory conditions (lab control). The altered gene expression profile was analyzed by Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) representing whole-transcript coverage. Each one of the 28853 genes is represented on the array by approximately 26 probes spread across the full length of the gene, providing a more complete and more accurate picture of gene expression than the 3' based expression array design. A few days of microgravity were sufficient to determinate, at least at the molecular level, an effect in the BMSC; this response expressed a stress condition able to determinate consequences on several compartments and cellular functions. In particular, it seems to promote a gene expression, known to be associated with neurogenic activity (e.g. axon guidance), perhaps promoting the BMSC capability to be committed in that direction. The osteo-induction, by dexamethasone-based medium, due to the short duration of stimulation, did not have the possibility to manifest itself at the phenotypic level but only partially at the molecular level.",

In that purpose, the alpha-proteobacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H, was sent twice to the International Space Station and was analyzed post-flight using a newly developed R. rubrum whole genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput gel-free proteomics with Isotope-Coded Protein Label technology. Moreover, in an effort to identify a specific response of R. rubrum S1H to space flight, simulation of microgravity and space-ionizing radiation were performed on Earth under identical culture set-up and growth conditions as encountered during the actual space journeys. Transcriptomic and proteomic data were integrated and permitted to put forward the importance of medium composition and culture set-up on the response of the bacterium to space flight-related environmental conditions. In addition, we showed for the first time that a low dose of ionizing radiation (2 mGy) can induce a significant response at the transcriptomic level, although no change in cell viability and only a few significant differentially expressed proteins were observed. From the MELiSSA perspective, we could argue the effect of microgravity to be minimized, whereas R. rubrum S1H could be more sensitive to ionizing radiation during long-term space exploration mission.",

      "description": "Changes in gravitational force such as that experienced by astronauts during space flight induce a redistribution of fluids from the caudad to the cephalad portion of the body together with an elimination of normal head-to-foot hydrostatic pressure gradients. To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift, a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent, all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly, the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes, while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction, Adhesion, Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered, including sodium channel, nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b), glutamate receptor (Grin1), voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1), calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response, learning and memory, ion channels and cell junction. In particular, data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore, HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1, C2, C3, C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1, E2, E3, E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by the Microarray Core Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the multiple yellow design (i.e.: C1C2, C3C4, E1E2, E3E4), described in Iacobas DA, Fan C, Iacobas S et al., Transcriptomic changes in developing kidney exposed to chronic hypoxia.

Wild type mice (n equals 3) were launched by Space Shuttle Discovery and housed on the International Space Station (ISS) for 91 days. They returned to the Earth by Space Shuttle Atlantis. But only one mouse returned to the Earth alive. Whole brain was sampled from the mouse killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide at the Life Sciences Support Facility of Kennedy Space Center within 3-4 hours after landing. After the spaceflight experiment, the on-ground experiment was also carried out at the Advanced Biotechnology Center in Genova, Italy. A mouse with the same species, sex, and age was housed in mice drawer system (MDS), which was utilized for the spaceflight (SF) mice, for 3 months as the ground control (GC). Another mouse was housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory control (LC). Amount of food and water supplementation and environmental conditions were simulated as the flight group. After 3 months, brain was sampled from one mouse in group GC and LC, respectively. Comprehensive analyses of gene expression were performed in the right brain. Total of 4,000 genes were analyzed. The expression levels of 60 genes significantly changed in response to SF compared with LC and/or GC. The 15 and 16 genes were up- (greater than 2 folds) and down-regulated (less than 0.5 folds), respectively, following SF vs. GC. The levels of 58 genes were significantly altered by housing in MDS in space and/or on the ground. Forty seven and 11 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated vs. LC. Twenty seven out of these genes responded to caging in MDS both in space and on the ground. Further, 31 genes were influenced by housing in MDS on the Earth. Responses of the characteristics of brain to long-term gravitational unloading were investigated in mice.",

      "description": "Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that reducing gravity levels in the International Space Station (ISS) causes important alterations in Drosophila gene expression. However, simulation experiments on ground, without space constraints, show weaker effects than space environment. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps, reveals a subtle response of the transcriptome using different populations and microgravity and hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that, in addition to behavioural responses that can be detected also at the gene expression level, the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. The alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have effects on gene expression that depends both on the environmental conditions and the ground based facility used to compensate the gravity vector. Alternative and commons effects of mechanical facilities, like the Random Positioning Machine and a centrifuge, and strong magnetic field ones, like a cryogenically cooled superconductive magnet, are discussed. We compare the effects over the gene expression profile of different sex/age Drosophila imagoes in 3-4 days-long experiments under altered gravity conditions into three GBF (Ground Based Facilities for micro/hyper- gravity simulation) using whole genome microarray platforms. Descriptions of different GBFs (treatments): LDC means Large Diameter Centrifuge. Samples can be placed under three conditions: inside LDC (at certain g level), at the LDC rotational control and at external 1g control (outside the LDC). RPM means Random Positioning Machine. Samples can be placed under two conditions: inside RPM (at nearly 0g, Microgravity level) and at external 1g control (outside the RPM). At the magnet, means INSIDE the Magnetic levitator (another GBF). Samples can be placed under four conditions: inside Magnet 0g* (at microgravity with magnetic field), inside Magnet at 1g* (internal control with magnetic field) or inside the magnet 2g* (at hypergravity with magnetic field) and at external 1g control (outside the magnet)",

In nature, Arabidopsis is a native of Europe/Asia/Northwestern Africa and is found across the globe growing in a wide range of environments. The geographical spread of these various populations has led to a slow divergence leading to distinct ecotypes. Understanding the impact of this ecotypic variability is an important factor when using Arabidopsis as a model. Seeds of the ecotypes Col_0, Ler-2, Ws-2 and Cvi-0 were flown to the International Space Station as part of CRS-4 mission in the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware. The seeds were germinated on orbit, grown for 8 days and then fixed in RNAlater and frozen in the MELFI freezer for return to Earth. Once returned RNA was isolated and RNAseq performed to catalog the transcriptional patterns of the plants grown in space. An identical set of samples were grown in parallel on the ground to provide controls to allow assessment of transcriptional changes specifically associated with the spaceflight environment.

      "description": "On Earth plants are constantly exposed to a gravitational field of 1G. Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants, the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study, Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized, plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth, the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls. After the spaceflight, tissue from five plates was pooled to make each of three replicates. Both membrane and soluble proteins were extracted from the pooled seedlings. Proteins were trypsin digested, labelled with iTRAQ and identified using tandem mass spectrometry.",

These cultures were then subjected to both transcriptomic and proteomic analysis and compared with the corresponding ground control. Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput proteomics, which offer the possibility to survey respectively the global transcriptional and translational response of an organism, were used to test the effect of space flight. Moreover, in an effort to identify a specific stress response of R. rubrum to space flight, ground simulation of space ionizing radiation and space gravity were performed under identical culture setup and growth conditions encountered during the actual space journey. This study is unique in combining the results from an actual space experiment with the corresponding space ionizing radiation and modeled microgravity ground simulations, which lead to a more solid dissection of the different factors contribution acting in space flight conditions. Total RNA was extracted from R. rubrum S1H grown after 10 days in space flight or after 10 days in simulated ionizing radiation or simulated microgravity. Each microarray slide contained 3 technical repeats.",

The present study focused on temperature, profiling the altered gene expression that develops under low cultivation temperatures in C. elegans, used as a space life science model. The 7903 genes were selected as differentially expressed genes, and divided into five sets with similar expression patterns using k-means clustering. Results from Gene Ontology analysis are significantly indicated that the cell cycle related genes, and the TGF?/insulin-like signal pathway related genes changed. The TGF?/insulin-like signal pathway is expected to be activated due to low temperatures, as well as by other stressors. To determine the genes whose expression changed four thermal conditions (10, 15, 20, and 25 Â¡C), DNA microarray analysis was performed. The data consisted of 12 samples, consisting of three biological replicates at each temperature.",

      "description": "Plants exhibit a robust transcriptional response to gamma radiation which includes the induction of transcripts required for homologous recombination and the suppression of transcripts that promote cell cycle progression. Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as collateral damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons, on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the DSB response were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes). Gamma irradiations were completed at 8:40 am, while HZE irradiations were conducted in two runs (due to space limitations) which were completed at 1:09 and 1:28pm respectively. Gamma treated seedlings were sampled at 10:10 am, 11:40 am, 2:55 pm, 8:40 pm, and 8:40 am. HZE treated seedlings were sampled at 2:39 pm, 4:09 pm, 7:24 pm, 1:09 am, and 1:09 pm. Un-irradiated WT and atm-1 control seedlings were sampled at 10:45 am on Day #1 and 9:15 am on Day #2. There are a total of 22 experimental or control conditions, with two replicates per condition, yielding 44 samples overall.",

We hypothesized the space environment leads to the release of biomolecules circulating inside the blood stream. Through datamining we identified 13 candidate microRNAs (miRNA) which are common in all studies and directly interact with TGF-Î²1 that can be potential circulating factors impacting space biology.

We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.",

      "description": "Microgravity has a dramatic impact on human physiology, illustrated in particular with skeletal muscle impairment. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms leading to loss of muscle mass and structural disorders is necessary for the definition of efficient clinical and spaceflight countermeasures. We investigated the effects of long-term bed rest on transcriptome of soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles in healthy women (BRC group, n equals 8), and the potential beneficial impact of protein supplementation (BRN group, n equals 8) and of a combined resistance and aerobic training (BRE group, n equals 8). Gene expression profiles were obtained using an in-house made microarray containing 6681 muscles-relevant genes. A two-class statistical analysis was applied on the 2103 genes with consolidated expression. We identified 472 and 207 modified genes, respectively for SOL and VL in BRC group. Further clustering approaches, identifying relevant biological mechanisms or pathways, underlined five main subclusters. Three are composed almost of upregulated genes involved mainly in nucleic acid and protein metabolism, and two composed almost of downregulated genes involved in energy metabolism. Exercise countermeasure demonstrated a drastic compensatory effect, decreasing the number of differentially-expressed genes by 89 and 96% in SOL and VL. In contrast, nutrition countermeasure had a moderate effect and decreased the number of differentially-expressed genes by 40 and 25% in SOL and VL. Our results allowed reporting a systematic, global and comprehensive view of long-term woman muscle atrophy and brought new lights and insights for space environment and for women who undergo a long-term clinical bed rest. Biological samples were collected from Pre- and Post- bed rest (BR) soleus and vastus lateralis biopsies of each subject from the three groups (bed rest only: BRC; Exercise: BRE; Nutrition: BRN). six technical replicate values (2 duplicate hybridizations a et b to chips with triplicate spots xxx) were obtained for each skeletal muscle sample. Thus for each subject, 12 expression measurements (6 before BR and 6 after BR) were obtained for each muscle.",

It has been suggested that this situation occurs in some age-related diseases and some pathological conditions observed in space, such as cardiovascular deconditioning, bone loss, muscle atrophy, and impaired immune responses. All of these are associated with endothelial dysfunction but the precise mechanism is still unclear. We used the microarray approach to obtain insights into the mechanism responsible for endothelial dysfunction by taking advantage of the challenging environment of gravitational unloading onboard the International Space Station.

Differentially regulated genes included those important for DNA repair, oxidative stress, and protein folding/degradation. Microarrays comprising 234 well characterized stress-related genes were used to profile transcriptomic changes in six astronauts before and after short-duration spaceflight. Blood samples were collected for analysis from each eastronaut 10 days prior and 2-3 hours after return from spaceflight. Data submitted for platform GPL140 contain genes that have been pre-filtered by the analytical software to remove values of low certainty, resulting in missing values for some samples.

      "description": "Microgravity alters the immune response to in vitro LPS assault engineered in spaceflight: A multi-omics study Microgravity can facilitate creation of a potent environment for opportunistic infection by augmenting virulence and suppressing the host defense. Presumably, extraterrestrial infection may trigger potentially novel bionetworks different from the terrestrial equivalent, which could only be probed by investigating the host-pathogen relationship with minimum terrestrial bias. Towards this objective, we strategically engineered a cell culture module equipped with a feedback controlled semi-automated platform to expose human endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The assay was carried out in the STS-135 space shuttle, and a concurrent ground study constituted the baseline. Transcriptomic investigation revealed an immune blunting in microgravity; Lbp, MyD88 and MD-2 failed to encode proteins responsible for early LPS uptake. Longer exposure results implied that there was a delayed response, potentially ineffectual in preventing pathogens from opportunistically modulating the infection network. Lack of recruitment of growth factors and a debilitated apoptosome supported this potential explanation. Certain cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, surged in response to LPS insult in microgravity. Contrasting expressions of B2M, TIMP-1 and VEGRs suggested impaired pro-survival adaptation and healing mechanisms. The susceptibility of oxidative stress and immune regulation to microgravity compelled further investigation of the respective microRNA modulators such as miR-200a and miR-146b. These miRNAs were expressed differently in response to LPS assaults in different gravitational limits. In conclusion, despite a serious drawback attributed to the small sample size, we delineated some of the important aspects of the extraterrestrial etiology; more comprehensive follow up studies are warranted. Present study though compromised by the small sample size was able to shade lights on several aspects of immunological responses to the endotoxic assault mediated by uG. Implementing the host-pathogen interactions in the spaceflight and subsequently lysing the cells onboard presented the critical distinguishing features of the present study from the past reports. We identified the CCM of Tissue Genesis, Inc., HI as the suitable hardware system to carry out the experiment in the spaceflight. CCM is an automated, feedback controlled module that can concurrently support 24 bioreactors following protocols exclusively programmed for individual bioreactor. For this experiment we use samples EA41, EA 47, EA45, and EA155 that were exposed to LPS for 4 hours. Samples EA123, EA165, EA127, EA126 were exposed to LPS for 8Hrs. Samples EA33, EA 125, EA79 and EA 39 were controls in this experiment.",

The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response, signal transduction, regulation of response to stress, regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F), apoptosis (eg.

Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. microRNA expression profiling were carried out on total RNA extracted from PBLs of twelve healthy donors at the end of 24h-incubation time in MMG and in 1g conditions. Analyses were performed by using the Human miRNA Microarray kit (V2) (Agilent Technologies), that allows the detection of 723 known human (miRBase v.10.1) and 76 human viral miRNAs. By comparing the expression profile of MMG-incubated vs. 1g-incubated PBLs of the same donor, we found 42 differentially expressed miRNAs, 25 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated.",

However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.",

      "description": "Space environment is suspected to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce oxidative stress in plants, however, little is known about the gene expression of ROS gene network in plants grown in long-term space flight. RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna, respectively, when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated, including high expression of 4 hallmarks, and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network , MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3, OXI1-MKK4-MPK3, and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades, induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade, induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested. RbohD and RbohF genes were up-regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes, which produce ROS.Conclusions: Our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the space environment induced oxidative stress and ROS gene network was activated in the space-grown Mizuna, some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and were preferentially up-regulated genes by the space environment, even though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground, showing that plants could acclimate to the space environment by reprograming the expression of ROS gene network.",

Zebrafish embryos were placed on a Large Diameter Centrifuge at 3 hpf, brought to a gravitational force of 3 g until 5 dpf. Reference embryos were kept in parallel at 1g (Inc). At 5dpf, one batch was left at 3g (3g), one batch was returned to 1g (3g>1g), while a third batch was returned to 1g, but left on the axis of the centrifuge (Axe; 3g>Axe).

Gene expression in the skin of 3 space mice and of 3 ground mice was analyzed by microarray. As this unique experiment performed on 3 mice limits the power of statistical analyis, as the transgene PTN/OSF1 was not overexpressed in skin and as a pair wise Pearson's correlation rates between the individual levels of expressed transcripts in the WT and the Tg mice were not significantly different from each other in one experimental group (space or ground), data from the 3 mice were combined to compare results from the space an ground groups.",

      "description": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae flocculation occurs when fermentable sugars are limiting and is therefore considered as a way to enhance the survival chance of Flo-expressing yeast cells. In this paper, the role of Flo1p in mating was demonstrated by showing that the mating efficiency, which contributes to the increased survival rate as well by generating genetic variability, is increased when cells flocculate. This was revealed by liquid growth experiments in a low shear environment and differential transcriptome analysis of FLO1 expressing cells compared to the non-flocculent wild-type cells. The results show that a floc provides a uniquely organized multicellular ultrastructure that provides a suitable microenvironment to induce and perform cell conjugation. S. cerevisiae strains BY4742 WT, BY4742::FLO8 and BY4742 [FLO1] were grown in microgravity and 1-g. A transcriptomic analysis was performed and the transcriptome data were integrated with the high quality protein-protein interaction networks. The identified high score sub-networks (qvalue < 0.001) were considered and further evaluated concerning their GO enrichment using a hypogeometric test. The data were from the Ying B-1 experiment.",

      "description": "As part of an ongoing effort to catalogue microbial communities inhabiting the International Space Station (ISS), crew-associated environmental samples were collected from the Japanese Kibo, Russian, and US research modules. Initial analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 11 Bacillus isolates (two from Kibo Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), four from US Segment Harmony Node 2 and five from Russian Segment Zvezda module sites), all belonging to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group. Isolates were further characterized by whole genome comparative analysis. Each isolate was sequenced, assembled, and aligned against all members of the B. cereus sensu lato group. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 - 5.3 Mbp), strain nucleotide identity (>99.99%), and maximum likelihood phylogenetic placement, all isolates were found to exhibit a very high level of similarity. With respect to gene content, all isolates were inspected for cry proteins common to B. thuringiensis as well as toxins specific to B. cereus. No significant hits were found to any known cry genes, while full-length matches were found for multiple B. cereus toxin genes. Finally, the isolates were closely screened against B. anthracis genomes, and no B. anthracis signatures were identified. Notably, all isolates contained the plcR ancestral C allele and lacked significant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids and toxins. The collective results from the analysis confirm that these strains belong to a previously uncharacterized Bacillus species, hereafter referred to as Bacillus issensis. The type strain is ISSFR-003T (=NRRL B-65389T= DSMZ 101676T).",

We hypothesized that the microbial population of environmental surfaces changes in time due to astronauts' activity and might be location specific. The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the ISS during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart). The specific objective was to unveil the viable microbial diversity of each location during two separate sessions in terms of abundance and richness of the communities. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection, contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25C. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A, Blood Agar, and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently, viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (102 to 103 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (105 to 109 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides, polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the ISS covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable, total, and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms, which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health, the ISS maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems.",

A. fumigatus can adapt to various environmental conditions and form airborne conidia that are the inoculum for a variety of diseases (e.g. non- and invasive pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, etc.) in immunocompromised hosts. In an on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) molecular phylogeny of several fungal isolates were characterized. Two strains, ISSF 21 and IF1SW-F4, were isolated from the HEPA filter and the surface of the Cupola of the ISS, respectively. Using primers targeting the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and 2, both isolates were identified as A. fumigatus. The whole genome sequence analysis of ISSF 21 revealed increased number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when compared to the reference A. fumigatus 293. Knowing that A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen and microgravity highly influences the antibiotic susceptibility and pathogenicity of microorganisms, we examined pathogenicity of both ISS isolates using the zebrafish larval model. The space station isolates (ISSF-021 and IF1SW-F4) were more virulent than two clinical strains (Af293 and CEA10) whose pathogenicity was highly characterized.

However, simulation experiments on ground testing space-related environmental constraints, show differential responses. Curiously, although particular genes are not common in the different experiments, the same GO groups including a large multigene family related with behavior, stress response and organogenesis are over represented in them. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps, reveals different degrees in the responses of the transcriptome when using different environmental conditions or microgravity/hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. In regular environmental conditions the alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have mild effects on gene expression but when environmental conditions are far from optimal, the gene expression is much more intense and consistent effects.",

      "description": "One of the most likely risks astronauts on long duration space missions face is exposure to ionizing radiation associated with highly energetic and charged heavy (HZE) particles. Since access to medical expertise on such a mission is limited at best, early diagnosis and mitigation of such exposure is critical. In order to accurately determine the dosage within 1 hour post-exposure, dose-dependent biomarkers are needed. Therefore, we performed a dose-course transcriptional analysis for radiation exposure at 0, 0.3, 1.5, and 3.0 Gy with corresponding time point at 1 hour (hr) post-exposure using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST v1 Array chips. The analysis of our data suggests a set of sensitive genetic biomarkers specific to each radiation level as well as generic radiation response biomarkers. Upregulated biomarkers can then be used within lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems to detect exposure to ionizing radiation. A total of sixteen human samples representing radiation exposure at levels 0 Gy, 0.3 Gy, 1.5 Gy and 3.0 Gy at time point 1 hour (hr) post-exposure were constructed. Blood samples were extracted from four human volunteers, and were irradiated. Leukocytes were extracted, and gene expression was measured. Samples for all four volunteers were measured at 1 hr for all four dose levels, resulting in four replicates at each dose level. Thus, a total of 4 samples at each of the four radiation levels were sampled, yielding the total of 16 samples.",

      "description": "We report how high and low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, microgravity, and elevated dietary iron affect colon microbiota (determined by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing) and colon function. Three independent experiments were conducted: 1) fractionated low LET gamma radiation (137Cs, 3 Gy, RAD), high Fe diet (IRON) (650 mg/kg diet), and a combination of low LET gamma radiation and high Fe diet (IRON+RAD) in male Sprague-Dawley rats; 2) high LET 38Si particle exposure (0.050 Gy), 1/6 G partial weight bearing (PWB), and a combination of high LET38Si particle exposure and PWB in female BalbC/ByJ mice; and 3) 13 d spaceflight in female C57BL/6 mice. For each experiment, the colon was resected and feces removed for microbial sequencing analysis on a Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium instrument (Microbiome Core Facility, Chapel Hill NC) using the GS FLX Titanium XLR70 sequencing reagents and protocols. Analysis of amplicon sequencing data was carried out using the QIIME pipeline. Low LET radiation, high iron diet, and spaceflight increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes. Low LET radiation, high Fe diet, and spaceflight did not significantly affect diversity or richness, or elevate pathogenic genera. Spaceflight increased Clostridiales and decreased Lactobacillales, and similar trends were observed in the experiment using a ground-based model of microgravity, suggesting altered gravity may affect colonic microbiota. Microbiota characteriztion in these models is a first step in understanding the impact of the space environment on intestinal health.",

      "description": "Densely ionizing radiation is a major component of the space radiation environment and has potentially greater carcinogenic effect compared to sparsely ionizing radiation that is prevalent in the terrestrial environment. It is unknown to what extent the irradiated microenvironment contributes to the differential carcinogenic potential of densely ionizing radiation. To address this gap, 10-week old BALB/c mice were irradiated with 100 cGy sparsely ionizing g-radiation or 10, 30, or 80 cGy of densely ionizing, 350 MeV/amu Si particles and transplanted 3 days later with syngeneic Trp53 null mammary fragments. Tumor appearance was monitored for 600 days. Tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice had a shorter median time to appearance, grew faster and were more likely to metastasize. Most tumors arising in sham-irradiated mice were ER-positive, pseudo-glandular and contained both basal keratin 14 and luminal keratin 8/18 cells (designated K14/18), while most tumors arising in irradiated hosts were K8/18 positive (designated K18) and ER negative. Comparison of K18 vs K14/18 tumor expression profiles showed that genes increased in K18 tumors were associated with ERBB2 and KRAS while decreased genes overlapped with those down regulated in metastasis and by loss of E-cadherin. Consistent with this, K18 tumors grew faster than K14/18 tumors and more mice with K18 tumors developed lung metastases compared to mice with K14/18 tumors. However, K18 tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice grew even faster and were more metastatic compared to control mice. A K18 Si-irradiated host profile was enriched in genes involved in mammary stem cells, stroma, and Notch signaling. Thus systemic responses to densely ionizing radiation enriches for a ER-negative, K18-positive tumor, whose biology is more aggressive compared to similar tumors arising in non-irradiated hosts. Key Words: ionizing radiation; breast cancer; heavy ion radiation;initiation; promotion 3 different dose of Si were used. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyzed a total of 45 Trp53-null tumors: 18 from sham-irradiated hosts, 9 from 10 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, 10 from 30 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, and 8 from irradiated hosts.",

For this reason, the specific period of treatment was chosen between 5-6 days post-fertilization (dpf), when bone formation and calcification are taking place. Zebrafish larvae were placed at 5 dpf into a clinostat (CLINO) for 24 hours, which was shown to simulate microgravity by the specific rotational movements it generates. We show that CLINO exposure causes a clear decrease of bone formation, as illustrated by cranial skeleton staining of the bone matrix by Alizarin Red, by morphometric analysis of the resulting images. Thus, a whole genome micro-array experiment was conducted to identify genes that may be involved in the observed effect on bone formation.",

      "title": "Transcription profiling of human MCF10A cells subjected to ionizing radiation and treatment with transforming growth factor beta-1",
      "description": "Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta) is a tumor suppressor during the initial stage of tumorigenesis, but it can switch to a tumor promoter during neoplastic progression. Ionizing radiation (IR), both a carcinogen and a therapeutic agent, induces TGFbeta activation in vivo. We now show that IR sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) to undergo TGFbeta-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Non-malignant HMEC (MCF10A, HMT3522 S1 and 184v) were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment in monolayer culture, or treated with a low concentration of TGFbeta (0.4 ng/ml), or double-treated. All double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) HMEC underwent a morphological shift from cuboidal to spindle-shaped. This phenotype was accompanied by decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin, beta-catenin and ZO-1, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, fibronectin and vimentin. Furthermore, double-treatment increased cell motility, promoted invasion and disrupted acinar morphogenesis of cells subsequently plated in Matrigel. Neither radiation nor TGFbeta alone elicited EMT, even though IR increased chronic TGFbeta signaling and activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that double treated cells exhibit a specific 10-gene signature associated with Erk/MAPK signaling. We hypothesized that IR-induced MAPK activation primes non-malignant HMEC to undergo TGFbeta-mediated EMT. Consistent with this, Erk phosphorylation were transiently induced by irradiation, persisted in irradiated cells treated with TGFbeta, and treatment with U0126, a Mek inhibitor, blocked the EMT phenotype. Together, these data demonstrate that the interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways elicit heritable phenotypes that could contribute to neoplastic progression. Experiment Overall Design: Nonmalignant human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (passages 106 and 108) were seeded at cloning density in 35mm dishes (10^5 cells/dish). Cell culture medium consisted of 3ml/dish of MGEM serum free medium (Cambrex Inc.), supplemented or not with 400pg/ml recombinant Transforming Growth Factor-beta. Cells were irradiated or not 5h post plating using 160 KV X-ray with a total dose of 2Gy. Sham, IR-treated, TGFbeta-treated and double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) MCF10A cells were harvested 8 days post-IR. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, denatured in Trizol, scraped off the dish and subjected to chloroform extraction. After centrifugation, the upper phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA precipitates were resuspended in RNase free water and further purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Germany). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent Bio-Analyzer. The dataset analyzed by microarray included biological duplicates for each treatment in two independent experiments and three sham treated samples. Microarray data were generated at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Molecular Profiling Laboratory (http://hta.lbl.gov) using a high-throughput, automated GeneChip system (Affymetrix). Briefly, target preparation, HT_HG-U133A array plate hybridization setup, washing and staining were performed on an Affymetrix robotic system (GCAS) using version 2.1 protocols. Scanning (protocol version 2.2.09) was performed on a CCD-based high throughput scanner (Affymetrix). Samples were analyzed and clustered with the (UNO) One Color GenetrafficTM software version 3.2-12 (Iobion Informatics LLC, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Genes whose expression was specifically altered by treatment were defined as those in which dye ratio was more than 1.75-fold (mean log2ratio>0.8) from baseline in at least three out of the four treated samples compared to the three sham samples. Significance analysis tests (p<0.05) were performed using Excel between sham samples and either IR, TGFbeta or TGFbeta+IR samples.",

      "description": "We developed a mouse model that captures radiation effects on host biology by transplanting unirradiated Trp53 null mammary tissue to sham or irradiated hosts. Gene expression profiles of tumors that arose in irradiated mice are distinct from those that arose in naive hosts. Host irradiation induces a metaprofile consisting of gene modules representing stem cells, cell motility, macrophages and autophagy. Human orthologs of the host irradiation metaprofile discriminated between radiation-preceded and sporadic human thyroid cancers. An irradiated host centroid was strongly associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. When applied to sporadic human breast cancers, the irradiated host metaprofile strongly associated with basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Comparing host irradiation in the context of TGFB levels showed that inflammation was robustly associated with claudin-low tumors. The association of the irradiated host metaprofiles with estrogen receptor negative status and claudin-low subtype suggests that host processes similar to those induced by radiation underlie sporadic cancers. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyized a total of 32 p53null tumors from irradiated wild type mice: 9 from sham-irradiated hosts, and 23 from irradiated hosts.

Understanding this relationship between the physical and biological realms is important for NASA's space travel goals. We use combined RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR to profile changes in early Drosophila melanogaster pupae exposed to chronic hypergravity (3 g, three times Earth's gravity) to highlight gravity-dependent pathways and gene products.

      "title": "Age and Space Irradiation Modulate Tumor Progression: Implications for Carcinogenesis Risk",
      "description": "Age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is an important consideration when modeling the carcinogenesis process or estimating cancer risks. Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age, cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular, particularly DNA, damage. However, during middle-age, the incidence begins to decelerate and, for many tumor sites, it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression, and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z), high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts, issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old), which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals, substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals), with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice, to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus, 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis, the key players, FASN, AKT1, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex, were determined to be contributory. In sum, these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue, Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice, 8 samples from young irradiated mice, 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice, 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total RNA was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen), quantified and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1, 28s/18s = 2:1, RIN (RNA integrity number) >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion), and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina), and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina). Data were first analyzed for gene expression and then culled for present genes (genes that meet the criteria of detection p-value < 0.05). Expression above background was included in an expressed genes working data set for further analyses. Rank variant normalization was applied to the data before extensive analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was used to compare to the reference group, young unirradiated mice, and genes were then evaluated and validated.",

      "description": "Age plays a crucial role in the interplay between tumor and host; with further perturbations induced by irradiation. Proton irradiation on tumors induces biological modulations including inhibition of angiogenic and immune factors critical to ''hallmark'' processes impacting tumor development, in addition to physical targeting advantages. These advantages have provided promising results for proton therapy in cancer. Additionally, protons have implications for carcinogenesis risk of space travel (due to the high proportion of high energy protons in space radiation). Through a systems biology approach, we investigated how host tissue (i.e. splenic tissue) of tumor-bearing mice is altered with age, with or without whole-body proton exposure. Transcriptome analysis was performed on splenic tissue from adolescent (68 day) versus old (736 day) C57BL/6 male mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells with or without three fractionations of 0.5Gy (1GeV) proton irradiation. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that proton irradiation of adolescent hosts caused significant signaling changes within splenic tissues that support carcinogenesis within the mice, as compared to old subjects. Increases in cell cycling and immunosuppression in irradiated adolescent hosts with CDK2, MCM7, CD74, and RUVBL2 as the key players were involved in the regulatory changes in host environment response (i.e. spleen). These results suggest a significant biological component to proton irradiation, operative through host age, that would indicate a modulation of host's ability to support carcinogenesis in adolescence and the bestowal of resistance to immunosuppression, carcinogenesis, and genetic perturbation by old age.",

M. marinum and LHM4 were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARV) in a rotary cell culture system (RCCS) under normal gravity (NG) or low shear simulated microgravity (MG). To determine the effect of MG on the stress responses activated by the growth conditions, we used RNAseq to examine what genes were expressed. For RNAseq, the bacteria are harvested, RNA isolated and converted DNA (cDNA), and the cDNA sequenced. Using bioinformatics, the amount of expression of the different M. marinum genes were compared between the NG and MG samples. To make sure that we were examining only gene expression changes due to MG, only bacteria in early exponential growth were used in the RNAseq studies. Triplicate NG and MG cultures were used to generate samples of bacteria grown for ~40 hrs. We also grew triplicate cultures for 4 days and then diluted them again and grew them for another ~40 hrs so we could examine gene expression from bacteria exposed for a longer time. In summary, this study determined that waterborne mycobacteria alter their growth, expression of stress responses, and their sensitivity to oxidizing conditions when subjected to growth under MG.",

In this study, we performed whole lung C-ion irradiation using three different strains of mice to examine whether strain-dependent differences in radiation effects occur in high-LET C-ion thoracic irradiation. Murine strain-variance was evaluated by histopathological examination of intra-alveolar hemorrhage that is likely to occur during the early phase after irradiation, and of lung fibrosis during the late phase, occurring more than three months after irradiation. We also performed microarray analysis to identify the key genes that are differentially regulated in different mouse strains after C-ion irradiation and to determine the mechanism of strain-dependent pulmonary damage after high-LET C-ion irradiation. Eight-week old female inbred C3H/He Slc, C57BL/6J Jms Slc and A/J Jms Slc mice (3 kinds of mice) were used. The whole thorax of three mice was locally irradiated at 10 Gy with C-ion beams, with a reference beam, 137Cs gamma-rays (2 kinds of beam). Three mice of each strain (3 mice) were sacrificed, and immediately dissected for lung extraction at 6 h (6h sample).

Higher final cell counts, enhanced biofilm formation, increased virulence, and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics have been reported to occur for cells cultured in space . Most of these phenomena are theorized as being an indirect effect of an altered extracellular environment, where the carbon source uptake is inhibited and excreted acidic byproducts buildup around the cell due to the lack of gravity-driven transport forces. However, to date neither spaceflight results, ground-based studies, physical measurement techniques nor computational approaches have provided sufficient evidence needed to confirm this model. Gene expression data from the Antibiotic Effectiveness in Space (AES-1) experiment, however, have now allowed us to look into the biomolecular processes behind these observations and showed a systematic activation of glucose starvation and acid resistance genes. These results corroborate the reduced mass transport model proposed to govern bacterial responses to spaceflight. Furthermore, the gene expression data suggests that metabolism was stimulated in space, which could play a role in causing the observed increase in bacterial cell concentrations in microgravity. Similarly, the decrease in extracellular pH may also be involved with the reported increase in virulence in space.",

High-LET is considered to have a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) than low-LET radiations. However, the details of the effects have not been clearly determined. The aim of this study was to characterize the difference between high-LET and low LET radiations. The global effects of the three types of high-LET radiations (fast neutron, heavy ion (C) and thermal neutron) were compared with the low-LET radiation (gamma ray) using yeast DNA microarrays. Highly induced genes by the three types of high-LET radiations were those genes related to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress was one of the common factors associated with the four types of radiations. Oxidative stress induced by high-LET radiations may be more serious than that induced by gamma rays. Additionally, genes related to protein synthesis and the ubiquitin and proteasome system were detected. This suggests that more protein damages can be induced by high-LET radiation that denatures the proteins in yeast cells. The genes specifically altered by each type of high-LET radiation were also studied. Overall design: This series contains 4 kinds of irradiation-induced gene expression profiles. Triplicates hybridization was done in each irradiation exposure, and each array have high and low power scanned data respectively. All biological samples were collected independently.",

Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment, a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.",

      "description": "Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated greater than or equal to 2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated greater than or equal to 2-fold during simulated microgravity HARV growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions. Overall design: Differential gene expression was compared between RNA from S. mutans grown in normal gravity HARVs (n equals 3 independent cultures) and RNA from S. mutans grown in simulated microgravity HARVs (n equals 3 independent cultures)",

      "description": "Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients, but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth, the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development, and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss, trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules, bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins, chemokines, IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly, 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell, or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each, i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment, and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.",

      "description": "We examined molecular responses using transcriptome profiling in isolated left ventricular murine cardiomyocytes to 90 cGy, 1 GeV proton (1H) and 15 cGy, 1 GeV/nucleon (n) iron (56Fe) particles 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples according to the radiation (IR) response, and time after exposure with 56Fe-IR showing the greatest level of gene modulation. 1H-IR exposures showed little differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle, oxidative responses and transcriptional regulation functional groups. Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression. Individual transcription factors were inferred to be active at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long lived signaling mechanism for p38 MAPK signaling and NFATc4 activation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays supported the role of additional key transcription factors GATA-4, STAT-3 and NF-kB as regulators of the response at specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular response to 56Fe-IR is unique and shows long-lasting gene expression in cardiomyocytes, up to 28 days after exposure. Additionally, proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional activation via DNA binding play a role in the response to high charge (Z) and energy (E) particles (HZE). Our study may have implications for NASA's efforts to develop heart disease risk estimates for astronauts safety via identification of specific HZE-IR molecular markers and for patients receiving conventional and particle radiotherapy.

      "description": "Background/Objectives: The waterflea Daphnia is an interesting candidate for bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS). These animals are particularly promising because of their central role in the limnic food web and its mode of reproduction. However, the response of Daphnia to altered gravity conditions has to be investigated, especially on the molecular level, to evaluate the suitability of Daphnia for BLSS in space. Methods: In this study, we applied a proteomic approach to identify key proteins and pathways involved in the response of Daphnia to simulated microgravity generated by a 2D-clinostat. We analysed 5 biological replicates using 2D-DIGE proteomic analysis. Results: We identified 109 protein spots differing in intensity (p less than 0.05). Substantial fractions of these proteins are involved in actin microfilament organisation, indicating the disruption of cytoskeletal structures during clinorotation. Furthermore, proteins involved in protein folding were identified, suggesting altered gravity induced breakdown of protein structures in general. In addition, simulated microgravity increased the abundance of energy metabolism related proteins, indicating an enhanced energy demand of Daphnia. Conclusion: The affected biological processes were also described in other studies using different organisms and systems either aiming to simulate microgravity conditions or providing real microgravity conditions. Moreover, most of the Daphnia protein sequences are well conserved throughout taxa, indicating that the response to altered gravity conditions in Daphnia follows a general concept.",

The aim of this study was to investigate, at both morphological and global gene expression level, skeletal muscle adaptation to microgravity in mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL). Adult male mice C57BL/N6 were flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days on orbit (BF) or housed in a replicate flight habitat on Earth (BG) as reference flight control. In this study, we investigated for the first time gene expression adaptation to 30 days of microgravity exposure in mouse soleus and EDL, highlighting potential new targets for improvement of countermeasures able to ameliorate or even prevent microgravity-induced atrophy in future spaceflights. Overall Design: C57BL/N6 mice were randomly divided in 3 groups: Bion Flown (BF), mice flown aboard the Bion M1 biosatellite in microgravity environment for 30 days; Bion Ground (BG), mice housed in the same habitat of flown animals but exposed to earth gravity; and Flight Control (FC), mice housed in a standard animal facility.",

      "description": "Exposure to radiation provokes cellular responses controlled in part by gene expression networks. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which mostly regulate gene expression by degrading the messages or inhibiting translation. Here, we investigated changes in miRNA expression patterns after low (0.1 Gy) and high (2.0 Gy) doses of X-ray in human fibroblasts. At early (0.5 h) and late (6 and 24 h) time points, irradiation caused qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of miRNA levels, including miR-92b, 137, 660, and 656. A transient up-regulation of miRNAs was observed after 2 h post-irradiation following high doses of radiation, including miR-558 and 662. MicroRNA levels were inversely correlated with targets from mRNA and proteomic profiling after 2.0 Gy of radiation. MicroRNAs miR-579, 608, 548-3p, and 585 are noted for targeting genes involved in radioresponsive mechanisms, such as cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis. We suggest here a model in which miRNAs may act as hub regulators of specific cellular responses, immediately down-regulated so as to stimulate DNA repair mechanisms, followed by up-regulation involved in suppressing apoptosis for cell survival. Taken together, miRNAs may mediate signaling pathways in sequential fashion in response to radiation, and may serve as biodosimetric markers of radiation exposure. Overall design: The gene expression patterns in human fibroblasts after 2.0 Gy of low-LET radiation was determined at 2 and 24 hrs post-irradiation time in technical triplicates. Control non-irradiated samples were also prepared in triplicates.",

The reduction in gravity, or microgravity, represents a novel environment that can disrupt homeostasis of many physiological processes. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly clear that an organism's microbiome is critical for host health and examining its resiliency in microgravity represents a new frontier for space biology research. In this study, we examine the impact of microgravity on the interactions between the squid Euprymna scolopes and its beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri, which form a highly specific binary mutualism. First, animals inoculated with V. fischeri aboard the space shuttle showed effective colonization of the host light organ, the site of the symbiosis, during spaceflight. Second, RNA-Seq analysis of squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions exhibited extensive differential gene expression in the presence and absence of the symbiotic partner. Transcriptomic analyses revealed in the absence of the symbiont during modeled microgravity there was an enrichment of genes and pathways associated with the innate immune and oxidative stress response. The results suggest that V. fischeri may help modulate the host stress responses under modeled microgravity. This study provides a window into the adaptive responses that the host animal and its symbiont use during modeled microgravity.",

      "description": "Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",

We noted expression changes in genes involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, DNA repair, and cell wall structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. In addition, glycome profiling supported our expression analyses in that there was a difference in cell wall components between ground control and spaceflight-grown plants. Comparing our studies to those of the other BRIC-16 experiments demonstrated that, even with the same hardware and similar biological materials, differences in results in gene expression were found among these spaceflight experiments.",

For this reason, the specific period of treatment was chosen between 5-6 days post-fertilization (dpf), when bone formation and calcification are taking place. Zebrafish larvae were placed at 5 dpf into a Large Diameter Centrifuge and brought to a gravitational force of 3g or 5g for 24 hours. We show that this treatment causes a clear increase of bone formation, as illustrated by cranial skeleton staining of the bone matrix by Alizarin Red, by morphometric analysis of the resulting images and by gene expression studies of selected genes. Thus, a whole genome micro-array experiment was conducted to identify genes that may be involved in the observed effect on bone formation.",

It was hypothesized that a beneficial effect of EMF regarding chondrogenesis (COL2A) could be combined with an avoiding effect of SMG regarding hypertrophy (COLXA1) of cartilage. Pellet cultures of hMSCs formed cartilaginous tissue under the addition of growth factors (FGF; TGF-beta3). Pure SMG reduced COLXA1 expression but also COL2A expression of hMSCs. Pure EMF showed no gene expression changes of hMSCs during chondrogenic differentiation. Combining EMF/SMG resulted in a re-increase of COL2A but did not reach control levels. The COL2A to COLXA1 ratio of combined EMF/SMG was not significantly different from control levels.

Microgravity and 3D culture can profoundly modulate cell proliferation and survival. Here, we engineered microscale progenitor cardiac spheres from human pluripotent stem cells and exposed the spheres to simulated microgravity using a random positioning machine for 3 days during their differentiation to cardiomyocytes. Methods: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit and the TrueSeq method was employed for mRNA enrichment. The libraries were quantified and samples were multiplexed in each lane of the flowcell. Cluster generation was performed and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq1000 system. Reads were mapped on the Human Genome Reference and normalized expression table was generated. Results: Among differentially expressed genes, 53 of them were up-regulated and 75 were down-regulated. Conclusions: Data demonstrate increased expression of genes associated with growth, development, and pro-survival in cardiac progenitors cultured under simulated microgravity compared with those cultured under standard gravity. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed to compare global gene expression profiles of cells at differentiation day 8 under simulated microgravity vs. standard gravity.",

We identified a novel role for RAD51 in innate immune response signaling. Defects in RAD51 lead to the accumulation of self-DNA in the cytoplasm, triggering a STING-mediated innate immune response after replication stress and DNA damage. Our data suggest that in addition to playing roles in homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break repair and replication fork processing, RAD51 is also implicated in the suppression of innate immunity. Thus, our study reveals a previously uncharacterized role of RAD51 in initiating immune signaling, placing it at the hub of new interconnections between DNA replication, DNA repair, and immunity.

      "description": "Proton irradiation is touted for its improved tumor targeting due to the physical advantages of ion beams for radiotherapy. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that, in addition to targeting advantages, proton irradiation can inhibit angiogenic and immune factors and thereby modulate tumor progression. High-energy protons also constitute a principal component of the galactic cosmic rays to which astronauts are exposed. Increased understanding of the biological effects of proton exposure would thus contribute to both improved cancer therapy and carcinogenesis risk assessment for space travel. In addition, age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is a critical consideration for estimating cancer risk. We investigated the effects of host age and proton exposure on tumor progression. Tumor lag time and growth dynamics were tracked following injection of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells into young (68 day) versus old (736 day) mice with or without coincident irradiation. Tumor progression was suppressed in old compared to young mice. Differences in progression were further modulated by proton irradiation (1GeV), with increased inhibition evident in old mice. Through global transcriptome analysis, TGFB1 and TGFB2 were determined to be key players that contributed to the tumor dynamics observed. These findings point to older hosts providing decreased systemic tumor support, which can be further inhibited by proton irradiation. Overall design: For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue, Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. For tumor replicates, thirty tumor samples from adolescent and thirty tumor samples from old mice, for a total of 60 tumor samples, were used. All replicate samples were run individually. For each age group, ten tumor samples had received proton irradiation while twenty tumor samples were from unirradiated mice (as described above). Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had 28s/18s = 2:1, RIN >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using AmbionTotalPrep, and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan System. The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control. In GenomeStudio, data was background subtracted and rank invariant normalization was applied. Data was imported into MultiExperiment Viewer, MeV, for statistical analysis. The statistically significant genes were determined using MeV by applying a one-way ANOVA analysis with standard Bonferroni correction with a FDR <0.05 that resulted in a list of significant genes. Average gene expression signals <10 were filtered out due to signal being",

To find this effect, we examine the alteration of osteoclast activity under microgravity with the histological analysis or the expression analysis by RNA in-situ hybridization. Furthermore, since we have succeeded the establishment of the medaka osteoclast-specific transgenic lines, we perform the in-vivo imaging analyses for gene expression and cell mobility. Finally, to examine the gravity sensing system, we employ tooth and bone as the high density organs, which are highly sensitive to gravity, and perform the histological analysis and the gene expression analysis of such gravity-sensitive tissues at surrounding pharyngeal teeth and supporting bone.",

      "description": "Controlled hypobaria presents biology with an environment that is never encountered in terrestrial ecology, yet the apparent components of hypobaria are stresses typical of terrestrial ecosystems. High altitude, for example, presents terrestrial hypobaria always with hypoxia as a component stress, since the relative partial pressure of O2 is constant in the atmosphere. Laboratory-controlled hypobaria, however, allows the dissection of pressure effects away from the effects typically associated with altitude, in particular hypoxia, as the partial pressure of O2 can be varied. In this study, whole transcriptomes of plants grown in ambient (97 kPa/pO2 equals 21 kPa) atmospheric conditions were compared to those of plants transferred to five different atmospheres of varying pressure and oxygen composition for 24 h: 50 kPa/pO2 equals 10 kPa, 25 kPa/pO2 equals 5 kPa, 50 kPa/pO2 equals 21 kPa, 25 kPa/pO2 equals 21 kPa, or 97 kPa/pO2 equals 5 kPa. The plants exposed to these environments were 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown vertically on hydrated nutrient plates. In addition, 5 day old plants were also exposed for 24 h to the 50 kPa and ambient environments to evaluate age-dependent responses. The gene expression profiles from roots and shoots showed that the hypobaric response contained more complex gene regulation than simple hypoxia, and that adding back oxygen to normoxic conditions did not completely alleviate gene expression changes in hypobaric responses.",

In particular, loss of muscle mass and strength are triggered by weightlessness in humans during space flights, that is similarly observed as a result of physical inactivity conditions and aging on Earth. However, skeletal muscle tissue is of paramount importance for health maintenance (e.g. being essential to locomotion, heat production, and metabolism). To better prevent or eventually treat microgravity-induced muscle atrophy, its underlying mechanisms have first to be characterized in detail. Using cutting-edge quantitative proteomics, the aim of the present study was therefore to get an in depth view of the molecular regulations triggered by space conditions in skeletal muscles of mice during the 30-day flight of the BION-M1 biosatellite. As muscles differing in their fiber type composition appear to respond differently to microgravity (see above), we characterized here the differential response of the soleus, extensor digitorum longus and vastus lateralis muscles.",

      "description": "Interplanetary human spaceflight represents a formidable medical challenge, but also provides a unique platform for investigating human adaptation to extreme environmental changes. Understanding the long-term effects of isolation has relevance in a range of scenarios and it is well recognized that a better understanding of the relationship between environmental exposure and the epigenome can lead to more effective preventive measures. Here we conduct a longitudinal epigenetic, mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Firstly, we found that long-term isolation can induce global DNA methylation remodeling, and this change seems to be an active adaptation (rather than a random process or a by-product of the isolation). This study is the first to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between global epigenetic remodeling and isolation-induced mood state and biochemical changes. Secondly, by considering the location of methylation sites within the genome and using gene-pathway annotation, we were able to identify pathways that were significantly enriched in methylation events and consider their association with specific function and the timeline of the mission. Thirdly, via our definition of epi-entropy, a measure of entropy adapted to methylation events, we observed that the methylation remodeling produced a marked reduction in epi-entropy. Results suggest that DNA methylation change is an indicator of change rather than its by-product, i.e., there is a psychology-epigenome-metabolism model of long-term depression; DNA methylation programs the environment signal into the epigenome, which is subsequently transformed into the biochemical output and health outcome. Thus, longitudinal epigenetic profiling could code the effect of isolation and act as early indicators of latent health outcome. A longitudinal epigenetic, mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. 36 samples of blood cell DNA methylation profiling were obtained by Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, across 6 sampling points during the 520 days mission for all of the 6 crew members.",

Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires.

Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and IgÎº variable gene usage.

      "description": "In this study transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity-1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.",

      "description": "Bystander mechanisms that originate in the areas surrounding a tissue damage presumably play an important role participating in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Thus, identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study, we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis, Epi-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375, 0.375-0.625, 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity), accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p equals 0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52, 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2, S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover, the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways, p equals 2.04E-02), a common marker of direct irradiation response, and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p equals 4.52E-04), cell communication (p equals 1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p equals 2.54E-07), receptor binding (p equals 6.19E-04), calcium ion binding proteins (p equals 2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p equals 2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p equals 2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p equals 4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p equals 7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p equals 4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375, 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover, three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses.",

Human peripheral blood from healthy donors was irradiated ex vivo, and a 74-gene consensus signature was identified that distinguished between four radiation doses (0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy) and control samples. The same set of genes separated samples by exposure level at both six and 24 hours after treatment, with overlap evident only at the highest two doses (5 and 8 Gy). Expression of five genes (CDKN1A, FDXR, SESN1, BBC3 and PHPT1) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming low variability between donors as well as the predicted radiation response pattern. Experiment Overall Design: Radiation induced gene expression in human blood was measured at 6 and 24 hours after exposure to doses of 0, 0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy g-rays.

      "description": "This is a genome-wide approach to identifying genes persistently induced in the mouse mammary gland by acute whole body low dose ionizing radiation (10cGy), 1 and 4 weeks after exposure. Gene expression that is modified under these parameters were compared between Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote littermates in order to determine which genes induced or repressed by radiation were mediated via Tgfb1 status. Differential gene expression was analyzed in Tgfb1 heterozygote and wild type littermate 4th mammary glands, after whole body exposure to an acute dose of 10cGy ionizing radiation. Estrus cycle was normalized in all mice two days prior to irradiation by injection with an estrogen and progesterone mixture. It is widely believed that the carcinogenic action of ionizing radiation is due to targeted DNA damage and resulting mutations, but there is also substantial evidence that non-targeted radiation effects alter epithelial phenotype and the stromal microenvironment. Activation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta) is a non-targeted radiation effect that mediates cell fate decisions following DNA damage and regulates microenvironment composition; it could either suppress or promote cancer. Gene expression profiling shown herein demonstrates that low dose radiation (10 cGy) elicits persistent changes in Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote murine mammary gland that are highly modulated by TGFbeta. We asked if such non-targeted radiation effects contribute to carcinogenesis by using a novel radiation chimera model. Unirradiated Trp53 null mammary epithelium was transplanted to the mammary stroma of mice previously exposed to a single low (10 -100 cGy) radiation dose. By 300 days, 100% of transplants in irradiated hosts at either 10 or 100 cGy had developed Trp53 null breast carcinomas compared to 54% in unirradiated hosts. Tumor growth rate was also increased by high, but not low, dose host irradiation. In contrast, irradiation of Tgfb1 heterozygote mice prior to transplantation failed to decrease tumor latency, or increase growth rate at any dose. Host irradiation significantly reduced the latency of invasive ductal carcinoma compared to spindle cell carcinoma, as well as those tumors negative for smooth muscle actin in wild type but not Tgfb1 heterozygote mice. However, irradiation of either host genotype significantly increased the frequency of estrogen receptor negative tumors. These data demonstrate two concepts critical to understanding radiation risks. First, non-targeted radiation effects can significantly promote the frequency and alter the features of epithelial cancer. Second, radiation-induced TGFbeta activity is a key mechanism of tumor promotion. Keywords: Differential gene expression after low dose irradiation Two genotypes: TGBbeta1 heterozygote and wildtype mouse mammary glands. Two time points post-10cGy-irradiation per genotype (1 week, 4 weeks); control time point was 1 week post-sham-irradiation. Two or three replicates per time point.",

Potential confounding factors have not been fully addressed for gene expression-based biodosimetry approaches, such as we are developing. To begin addressing this need, we have used an ex vivo irradiated peripheral blood cell model to investigate the potential effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response, and looked for genes that respond to radiation differently in smokers and non-smokers, and also in males and females. The results indicate that only a small number of genes may be significantly confounded by either factor, supporting the idea of developing peripheral blood gene expression strategies for radiation biodosimetry. Blood from each of 24 different donors was exposed to four doses of ionizing radiation (0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2 Gy) and analyzed using single-color microarray hybridization. The donors represented equal numbers of male and female smokers (1 or more packs a day) and non-smokers.

      "description": "Accumulating data support the concept that ionizing radiation therapy (RT) has the potential to convert the tumor into an in situ, individualized vaccine; however this potential is rarely realized by RT alone. Transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is activated by RT and inhibits the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells and the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that TGFÎ² hinders the ability of RT to promote anti-tumor immunity. Development of tumor-specific immunity was examined in a pre-clinical model of metastatic breast cancer. Mice bearing established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma treated with pan-isoform specific TGFÎ² neutralizing antibody, 1D11, showed significantly improved control of the irradiated tumor and non-irradiated metastases, but no effect in the absence of RT. Notably, whole tumor transcriptional analysis demonstrated the selective upregulation of genes associated with immune-mediated rejection only in tumors of mice treated with RT+TGFÎ² blockade. Mice treated with RT+TGFÎ² blockade exhibited cross-priming of CD8+ T cells producing IFNÎ³ in response to three tumor-specific antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which was not evident for single modality treatment. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in mouse tumors showed a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only in mice treated with the combination of RT+TGFÎ² blockade. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the therapeutic benefit of RT+TGFÎ² blockade. These data identify TGFÎ² as a master inhibitor of the ability of RT to generate an in situ tumor vaccine, which supports testing inhibition of TGFÎ² during radiotherapy to promote therapeutically effective anti-tumor immunity. We used genome-wide microarray to depict main biological processes responsibles for the therapeutic benefit of the combination ofTGF-beta blockade and local radiotherapy. To gain a more comprehensice protrait of the effects of RT and TGFbeta blockade on gene expressionin tumors, we collected 4T1 tumors 4 days after completion of RT.

B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and IgÎº gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.",

      "description": "Airborne microorganisms in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere remain elusive due to a lack of reliable sample collection systems. To address this problem, we designed, installed, and flight-validated a novel Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC) for NASA's C-20A that can make collections for microbiological research investigations up to altitudes of 13.7 km. Herein we report results from the first set of science flightsâfour consecutive missions flown over the United States (US) from 30 October to 2 November, 2017. To ascertain how the concentration of airborne bacteria changed across the tropopause, we collected air during aircraft Ascent/Descent (0.3 to 11 km), as well as sustained Cruise altitudes in the lower stratosphere (~12 km). Bioaerosols were captured on DNA-treated gelatinous filters inside a cascade air sampler, then analyzed with molecular and culture-based characterization. Several viable bacterial isolates were recovered from flight altitudes, including Bacillus sp., Micrococcus sp., Arthrobacter sp., and Staphylococcus sp. from Cruise samples and Brachybacterium sp. from Ascent/Descent samples. Using 16S V4 sequencing methods for a culture-independent analysis of bacteria, the average number of total OTUs was 305 for Cruise samples and 276 for Ascent/Descent samples. Some taxa were more abundant in the flight samples than the ground samples, including OTUs from families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae as well as the following genera: Clostridium, Mogibacterium, Corynebacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, and Parabacteroides. Surprisingly, our results revealed a homogeneous distribution of bacteria in the atmosphere up to 12 km. The observation could be due to atmospheric conditions producing similar background aerosols across the western US, as suggested by modeled back trajectories and satellite measurements. However, the influence of aircraft-associated bacterial contaminants could not be fully eliminated and that background signal was reported throughout our dataset. Considering the tremendous engineering challenge of collecting biomass at extreme altitudes where contamination from flight hardware remains an ever-present issue, we note the utility of using the stratosphere as a proving ground for planned life detection missions across the solar system.",

      "description": "Radiation affects tissue and cellular integrity at the level of DNA, protein and metabolites of the cell and extracellular space. The effects of radiation are not limited to targeted cells and tissue and radiation induced bystander effects are significant to exposed individuals in accidental or therapeutic situations. These non-targeted effects of radiation have been studied extensively at the low dose range where they appear to have adverse effects on cells and surrounding environments. The requirement of cellular contact and shared fluid media has been established as critical to the bystander effect yet there is not much known about the actual signaling mechanism and its ability to transmit the damaging effect over space and time. Experimental cell types and context within the tissue are also quite important to the nature and extent of this bystander effect and must be considered when drawing parallels at the organismal level. Our approach was to use a genomic level analysis of global mRNA expression in primary lung fibroblast cells to understand the cellular triggers and mechanism of the bystander effect. Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggested that the p53 induced transcriptional response appears muted in bystanders while cytokine and cell signaling mechanisms such as those controlled by NFkB and p38 MAPK are highly active in both populations. We validated a large number of genes that are significantly changed at 4hrs after irradiation in both irradiated and bystander populations. We investigated time course gene expression profiles of cyclooxygenase2 (PTGS2), interleukin 8 (IL8) and BCL2 related protein 2 (BCL2A1), as genes that are involved in cellular signaling via the NFkB pathway, which revealed that there is a dramatic response at 0.5hr after irradiation followed by another wave at 4hr in both populations. The induction of interleukins such as cytokine IL8 and chemokine IL6 at the transcriptional level is both early and amplified and if followed by translation and secretion of these proteins could explain the concerted response seen in bystander cells. Our results are the first to show that there is a significant and distinct global response of cellular signaling genes in bystander cells with some genes showing a response as early as 0.5hr after irradiation which implies a fast moving intercellular signal that leads to a concerted response in the irradiated and bystander populations. Keywords: gene expression fold change There are 12 total samples, 4 corresponding biological replicates of IMR90 cells that were not irradiated (control=C), irradiated (alpha=A) and bystander (B)",

      "description": "The existence of a radiation bystander effect, in which non-irradiated cells respond to signals from irradiated cells, is well established. To understand early signaling and gene regulation in bystander cells, we used a bioinformatics approach, measuring global gene expression at 30 minutes and signaling pathways between 30 minutes and 4 hours after exposure to alpha-particles in IMR-90 fibroblasts. We used whole human genome microarrays and real time quantitative PCR to measure and validate gene expression. Microarray analysis was done using BRB-Array Tools; pathway and ontology analyses were done using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and PANTHER, respectively. We studied signaling in irradiated and bystander cells using immunoblotting and semi-quantitative image analysis. Gene ontology suggested signal transduction and transcriptional regulation responding 30 minutes after treatment affected cell structure, motility and adhesion, and interleukin synthesis. We measured time-dependent expression of genes controlled by the NF-kappaB pathway; matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3; chemokine ligands 2, 3 and 5 and interleukins 1beta, 6 and 33. There was an increased response of this set of genes 30 minutes after treatment and another wave of induction at 4 hours. We investigated AKT-GSK3beta signaling and found both AKT and GSK3beta are hyper-phosphorylated 30 minutes after irradiation and this effect is maintained through 4 hours. In bystander cells, a similar response was seen with a delay of 30 minutes. We proposed a network model where the observed decrease in phosphorylation of beta-catenin protein after GSK3beta dependent inactivation can trigger target gene expression at later times after radiation exposure. These results are the first to show that the radiation induced bystander signal induces a widespread gene expression response at 30 minutes after treatment and these changes are accompanied by modification of signaling proteins in the PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta pathway.",

      "description": "The radiation bystander effect is an important component of the overall biological response of tissues and organisms to ionizing radiation. Little is known about the contribution of genome level changes in neighboring bystander cells to tissue and organ stress after irradiation. The timing of these changes is critical in the physiological context and these questions can only be answered by studying signaling and global transcriptomics in a chronological way. Here, we present a strategy to identify different biologically important signaling modules that act in concert in the radiation and bystander responses. We used time series gene expression analysis of normal human fibroblast cells measured at 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after exposure to radiation coupled with a novel clustering method targeted to short time series, Feature Based Partitioning around medoids Algorithm (FBPA), to look for genes that were potentially co-regulated. This method uses biologically meaningful features of the expression profile and dimension augmentation to address the analysis of sparse data sets such as ours. We applied FBPA and Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM) to the same datasets and present the results of our comparisons using computational metrics as well as biological enrichment. Enrichment showed that gene expression in irradiated cells fell into broad categories of signal transduction, cell cycle/cell death and inflammation/immunity; but only FBPA clustered functions well. In bystander cells, the gene expression response was also broadly categorized into functions associated with cell communication and motility, signal transduction and inflammation; but neither STEM nor FBPA separated biological functions as well as in irradiated samples. Network analysis revealed that p53 and NF-kappaB were central players in gene expression in both irradiated and bystander gene clusters. Analysis of individual clusters also suggested new regulators of gene expression in the radiation and bystander response that may act at the epigenetic level such as histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2) and methylases (KDM5B) that can act as strong transcription repressors. Based on these results, we propose a novel time series clustering method, FBPA, as a powerful approach that can be applied to sparse data sets (including genomic profiling data), where the choice of features selected for clustering and stringent statistical outcome analysis can augment our knowledge of the underlying cellular mechanisms in biological processes. There are 72 total samples, 4 corresponding biological replicates of IMR90 cells that were not irradiated (control=C), irradiated (alpha=A) and bystander (B), cells were harvested at 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after treatment",

      "description": "Mitochondrial DNA-depleted human skin fibroblasts (HSF rho0) with suppressed oxidative phosphorylation were characterized by significant changes in the expression of 2100 nuclear genes, encoding numerous protein classes, in NF-kappaB and STAT3 signaling pathways and by decreased activity of the mitochondrial death pathway, compared to the parent rho+ HSF. In contrast, the extrinsic TRAIL/TRAIL-Receptor-mediated death pathway remained highly active, and exogenous TRAIL induced higher levels of apoptosis in rho0 cells compared to rho+ HSF. Global gene expression analysis using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that expression levels of many growth factors and their adaptor proteins (FGF13, HGF, IGFBP4, IGFBP6, IGFL2), cytokines (IL6, IL17B, IL18, IL19, IL28B) and cytokine receptors (IL1R1, IL21R, IL31RA) were substantially decreased after mitochondrial depletion. Some of these genes were targets of NF-kappaB and STAT3, and their protein products could regulate the STAT3 signaling pathway. Alpha-irradiation induced expression of several NF-kappaB/STAT3 target genes, including IL1A, IL1B, IL6, PTGS2/COX2 and MMP12, in rho+ HSF, but this response was substantially decreased in rho0 HSF. Suppression of the IKK-NF-kappaB pathway by the small molecular inhibitor BMS-345541 and of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway by AG490 dramatically increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the control and irradiated rho+ HSF. Inhibitory antibodies against IL6, the main activator of JAK2-STAT3 pathway, added into the cell media, also increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in rho+ HSF. However, NF-kappaB activation was partially lost in mitochondrial DNA-depleted HSF resulting in downregulation of the basal or radiation-induced expression of numerous NF-kappaB targets, further suppressing IL6-JAK2-STAT3, that in concert with NF-kappaB, regulated protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. There are 12 total samples, 3 biological replicates each of HSF rho+ and rho0 cells that were not irradiated (control=C) or irradiated (alpha=A). Cells were harvested at 4 hours after treatment.",

      "description": "Background: The radiation bystander response is an important component of the overall response of cells to radiation and critical to understanding health risks of radiation exposure to humans. The mechanism of radiation response includes inter-cellular signaling and intra-cellular communication by which the bystander signal is propagated. Methods: We measured the bystander response to 1Gy a-particle radiation in Mrad9-/- mouse stem cells and H1299shRAD9 cells, using chromosomal aberration and micronucleus formation as DNA damage endpoints. In the H1299 model we used whole genome microarray analyses to profile the transcriptome of irradiated and bystander cells. Results: We investigated the role of RAD9 in the bystander response and showed that depletion or mutation of RAD9 had an effect of increasing chromosomal structural damage as well as micronucleus formation in bystander cells. The enhancement of the damage effect correlated strongly with a transcriptomic response in critical pathways. RAD9 depletion affected many pathways in the cell, including the UV-MAPK pathway, involving p38MAPK members, STAT1 and PARP1 at the mRNA levels. There was an overall reduction of RNA biogenesis of gene members of this pathway suggesting that perhaps these signaling pathways do not function optimally after RAD9 depletion. Using network analysis we found there may be differential activation of transcriptional regulators between the irradiated and bystander cells involving the SP1 and NUPR1 transcription factors. Network analysis also suggested that HIF1a (Hypoxia induced factor 1a) activation could be a negative predictor of the bystander effect and perhaps that local hypoxic stress observed by cells that are directly exposed to radiation may predict whether or not they will elicit a bystander response. Gene expression in H1299 cells was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 1 Gy a-particles. There were two groups based on RAD9 status, RAD9 normal and RAD9 depleted by siRNA. In each of these groups, sham irradiated, direct irradiated cells for positive bystanders, positive bystanders, direct irradiated cells for negative bystanders and negative bystanders; were identified based on micronucleus responses. Five biological replicates were analyzed for each experimental group.",

Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups.

Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection.

      "description": "The introduction of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) probiotic microbes into the spaceflight food system has the potential for use as a safe, non-invasive, daily countermeasure to crew microbiome and immune dysregulation. However, the microgravity effects on the stress tolerances and genetic expression of probiotic bacteria must be determined to confirm translation of strain benefits and to identify potential for optimization of growth, survival, and strain selection for spaceflight. The work presented here demonstrates the translation of characteristics of a GRAS probiotic bacteria to a microgravity analog environment. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 was grown in the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) orientation and the control orientation in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) to determine the effect of LSMMG on the growth, survival through stress challenge, and gene expression of the strain. No differences were observed between the LSMMG and control grown L. acidophilus, suggesting that the strain will behave similarly in spaceflight and may be expected to confer Earth-based benefits.",

      "description": "The Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2), as a part of the HSF network, is essential to the plant's response to almost any environmental stress and to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms. Plant cell cultures disabled in HsfA2 function were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in order to ascertain whether or not they use the same terrestrially effective systems to adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight. Cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild type (WT) cultivar Col-0 and from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC17 spaceflight mission and were fixed in-flight after 10 days on orbit. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, differentially expressed genes were identified between the environments (spaceflight to ground) within cells of the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Second, gene expression profiles were identified between the genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, defining genes uniquely required by the two genotypes in the ground and spaceflight adapted states. The physiological state of the cells as a result of disabling a gene has tremendous control over the mechanisms induced to adapt to the environment of spaceflight. The HsfA2 demonstrated a role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment since the cells disabled in the HsfA2 gene used substantially different genes to achieve the spaceflight adapted state than the WT cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells' physiological state regardless of the environment and likely result from the deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery. HsfA2 seems to have a universal stress response role but also specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction and starch biosynthesis. Implementation of knock-out cells identified a set of genes with a required expression level in order for a cell to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state. The HSFA2 KO cells helped to unravel the HsfA2-dependent genes of the adaption of wild type cells to the environment of spaceflight.",

Obtaining root apex transcriptomes is therefore challenging when the samples are limited. The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined, comparing RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to microarrays in characterizing genes that are relevant to spaceflight.Methods:Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col-0) roots were sectioned into Zone 1 (0.5 mm; root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone 2 (1.5 mm; transition, elongation, and growth-terminating zone). Differential gene expression in each was compared.Results: Both microarrays and RNA-Seq proved applicable to the small samples. A total of 4180 genes were differentially expressed (with fold changes of 2 or greater) between Zone 1 and Zone 2. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel transcriptionally active regions were identified by RNA-Seq that were not detected in microarrays. However, microarrays detected spaceflight-relevant genes that were missed in RNA-Seq. Discussion: Single root tip subsections can be used for transcriptome analysis using either RNA-Seq or microarrays. Both RNA-Seq and microarrays provided novel information. These data suggest that techniques for dealing with small, rare samples from spaceflight can be further enhanced, and that RNA-Seq may miss some spaceflight-relevant changes in gene expression.",

      "description": "Harsh environmental conditions including microgravity and radiation during prolonged spaceflights are known to alter hepatic metabolism. Our studies have focused on the analysis of possible changes in metabolic pathways in livers of mice which experienced 30 days of spaceflight with and without an additional re-adaption period of 7 days compared to control mice on Earth. Utilizing shotgun mass spectrometry and label-free quantification, we performed proteomic profiling to investigate mice livers from the spaceflight project âBion-M 1â. No significant alterations in protein levels were observed between control mice liver and spaceflight mice which is possibly caused by insufficient fold change detection combined with high variances within the groups. In contrast, our results show that more than a third of the quantified protein levels are altered comparing the liver proteome of mice with and without re-adaption time after their spaceflight. Proteins related to amino acid metabolism showed higher levels after re-adaption, which may indicate higher rates of gluconeogenesis. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathway reconstitute their level after 7 days due to a decrease in fold change, which indicates decreased signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, bile acid secretion regenerates on Earth due to reconstitution of related transmembrane proteins and elevated levels of the drug-metabolising enzymes belonging to the CYP superfamily decrease 7 days after the spaceflight. Thus, our study demonstrates reconstitution of pharmacological response and early signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recover within 7 days, whereas glucose uptake should be monitored due to alterations in gluconeogenesis.",

CRESS was designed as a secondary payload for the December 2016 high-altitude, high-latitude, and long-duration balloon flight carrying the Boron And Carbon Cosmic Rays in the Upper Stratosphere (BACCUS) experimental hardware. Investigation of the biological effects of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), particularly those of ions with High-Z and Energy (HZE), is of interest due to the genomic damage this type of radiation inflicts. The biological effects of upper-stratospheric mixed radiation above Antarctica (ANT) were sampled using Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and were compared to those resulting from a controlled simulation of GCR at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and to laboratory control seed. The payload developed for Antarctica exposure was broadly designed to 1U CubeSat specifications (10cmx10cmx10cm, <1.33kg), maintained 1 atm internal pressure, and carried an internal cargo of four seed trays (about 580,000 seeds) and twelve CR-39 Solid-State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs). The irradiated seeds were recovered, sterilized and grown on Petri plates for phenotypic screening. BNL and ANT M0 seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates and elevated somatic mutation rates when compared to non-irradiated controls, with the BNL mutation rate also being significantly higher than that of ANT. Genomic DNA from mutants of interest was evaluated with whole-genome sequencing using PacBio SMRT technology. Sequence data revealed the presence of an array of genome structural variants in the genomes of M0 and M1 mutant plants.",

The objective of our spaceflight experiment âPlant Signaling in Microgravityâ (carried out on the International Space Station, ISS), was to compare transcript profiles of wild type and transgenic InsP 5-ptase plants with compromised InsP3 signaling. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively express the mammalian type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the lipid-derived second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). These transgenic plants exhibit normal growth and morphology; however, their responses to environmental stimuli including gravity and drought are altered. Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light in experimental containers placed in the European Modular Cultivation system (EMCS) onboard the ISS. The EMCS consists of two rotors within a controlled chamber, allowing for a â1gâ control in space. After sample retrieval from the ISS, RNA was isolated from shoot and root tissue and subjected to RNA sequencing. Two-way comparisons of micro g versus â1âg have uncovered regulatory mechanisms that are both conserved and altered between the wild type and transgenic seedlings.",

The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and three mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism.

      "description": "To understand the molecular mechanisms affected by spaceflight, it is essential to achieve high quality sample preservation on-orbit for downstream gene expression analysis. However, sample preservation protocols must also be compatible with available equipment and crew time. NASA's Rodent Research (RR) missions have used various methods for euthanasia, carcass preservation, and tissue preservation. This study extends the sample preservation study performed by GeneLab in GLDS-49 which examined conditions used for the RR-1 mission to include conditions used for multiple RR missions and is designed to help determine factors which may confound data analysis. To determine whether these various factors affect changes in gene expression, this ground-based study generated gene expression profiles measured by RNAseq from the livers of 20-21 week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Multiple, interacting factors were investigated: 1) To understand how euthanasia protocols affect gene expression when mouse carcasses are slow frozen, mice were euthanized by either euthasol injection, ketamine/xylazine injection, or CO2 inhalation, and carcasses slow frozen on dry-ice mimicking carcass preservation in the MELFI on the ISS.

      "description": "To understand the molecular mechanisms affected by spaceflight, it is essential to achieve high quality sample preservation on-orbit for downstream gene expression analysis. However, sample preservation protocols must also be compatible with available equipment and crew time. NASA's Rodent Research (RR) missions have used various methods for euthanasia, carcass preservation, and tissue preservation. This study extends the sample preservation study performed by GeneLab in GLDS-49 which examined conditions used for the RR-1 mission to include conditions used for multiple RR missions and is designed to help determine factors which may confound data analysis. To determine whether these various factors affect changes in gene expression, this ground-based study generated gene expression profiles measured by RNAseq from the quadriceps of 20-21 week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Multiple, interacting factors were investigated: 1) To understand how euthanasia protocols affect gene expression when mouse carcasses are slow frozen, mice were euthanized by either euthasol injection, ketamine/xylazine injection, or CO2 inhalation, and carcasses slow frozen on dry-ice mimicking carcass preservation in the MELFI on the ISS. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from quadriceps; 2) To understand how carcass preservation protocols affect gene expression, mice were euthanized with euthasol and carcasses preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, slow freezing on dry ice, or immersion in RNAlater following three-way segmentation. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from quadriceps; 3) To understand how tissue preservation protocols affect gene expression, mice were euthanized with euthasol and quadriceps immediately dissected and preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, slow freezing on dry ice, or immersion in RNAlater.",

      "description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission was to use mice to understand the molecular basis of phenomena that affect astronauts during long-duration spaceflight, particularly visual impairment and joint tissue degradation. To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 10 week-old male C57BL/6J mice were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing, euthanasia and dissection on 9/18/2018. A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals (8/15/2017). Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However, all the GC and VIV mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC and VIV studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May, 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018, while the VIV was euthanized and dissected 6/22/2018 - 6/23/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC and VIV controls as compared to the flight (FLT) and basal (BSL) groups, two cohort controls were included in the study. The first, Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1), was from the same cohort as the FLT and BSL animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second, Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2), was from the same cohort as the GC and VIV animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC and VIV groups, (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars. To clarify the connections between treatment groups and animal cohorts, the following group abbreviations are used in the sample metadata: Flight (FLT_C1); Basal (BSL_C1); Ground Control (GC_C2); Vivarium Control (VIV_C2), Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1); Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2). Upon dissection, livers were preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C before RNA was extracted, libraries generated (stranded, ribodepleted) and sequenced (target 60 M clusters at PE 150 bp).",

There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N of 20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive, to Novartis' Facilities, where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane, blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture, and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal, frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). This study features data from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups Flight: LAR (N of 8), ISS Terminal (N of 7); Ground Controls: LAR (N of 9), ISS Terminal (N of 7); Baseline: LAR (N of 10), ISS Terminal (N of 3). Total RNA was extracted and sequenced at a target depth of 60 M clusters per sample (ribodepleted, paired end 150).",

      "description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission was to use mice to understand the molecular basis of phenomena that affect astronauts during long-duration spaceflight, particularly visual impairment and joint tissue degradation. To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice was launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing, euthanasia and dissection on 9/18/2018. A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals (8/15/2017). Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However, all the GC and VIV mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC and VIV studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May, 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018, while the VIV was euthanized and dissected 6/22/2018 - 6/23/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC and VIV controls as compared to the flight (FLT) and basal (BSL) groups, two cohort controls were included in the study. The first, Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1), was from the same cohort as the FLT and BSL animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second, Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2), was from the same cohort as the GC and VIV animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC and VIV groups, (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars. To clarify the connections between treatment groups and animal cohorts, the following group abbreviations are used in the sample metadata: Flight (FLT_C1); Basal (BSL_C1); Ground Control (GC_C2); Vivarium Control (VIV_C2), Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1); Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2). Fecal pellets were isolated directly from mice during dissection and preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen before stored at -80 C. DNA was then extracted, shotgun metagenomic libraries generated, and libraries sequenced (target 10 M clusters at PE 250 bp). Metagenomic data was generated from the following groups: Basal Control (n=5), Ground Control (n=5), Vivarium Control (n=5), Cohort Control 1 (n=5), Cohort Control 2 (n=5), Flight (n=5).",

The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 hours. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.",

Samples of food, swabs from living surfaces, and fecal pellets were collected from each animal before launch and regularly during the mission. The mission also involved extended video collection (48 hr video segments per Habitat) to monitor circadian rhythms, and on-orbit mass measurement. After 25 days on-orbit, half of the mice of each strain were euthanized on the ISS with Ketamine/Xylazine/Acepromazine and cardiac puncture, after which carcasses were segmented in three sections and preserved in RNA later. After 75-76 days the remaining 5 animals from each group were euthanized and processed in the same manner. The 25-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-15, and the 75-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-16.

      "description": "Several studies have reported that microorganisms are co-transported with globally dispersed aerosols and that microbial DNA and viable cells have been detected at both low and high altitudes. In an effort to investigate how microbial patterns change with altitude, two research flights were flown using NASA's C-20A Gulfstream III aircraft over the Sierra mountains in the Southern California/Nevada region over two consecutive days. During each flight, the aircraft reached 40,000 ft and lowered to 30,000 ft, 20,000 ft, and 10,000 ft in a stair-step pattern. Bioaerosol samples were collected at each altitude for 30 minutes on gelatinous filters using the Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC). DNA was extracted from the bioaerosol sample. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the extracted DNA using an Illumina NextSeq 500.",

We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to study the effects of microgravity on cell-level cardiac function and gene expression. The hiPSC-CMs were cultured aboard the ISS for 5.5 weeks and their gene expression, structure, and functions were compared to ground control hiPSC-CMs. Exposure to microgravity on the ISS caused alterations in hiPSC-CM calcium handling. RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated 2,635 genes were differentially expressed among flight, post-flight, and ground control samples, including genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. This study represents the first use of hiPSCs to model the effects of spaceflight on human cardiomyocyte structure and function.",

      "description": "Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 was originally isolated from the Jet Propulsion Lab Spacecraft Assembly Facility and thoroughly characterized for its enhanced resistance to UV irradiation and oxidative stress. This unusual resistance of SAFR-032 is of particular concern in the context of planetary protection and calls for development of novel disinfection techniques to prevent extraterrestrial contamination. Previously, spores of SAFR-032 were exposed for 18âmonths to a variety of space conditions on board the International Space Station to investigate their resistance to Mars-like conditions and space travel. Here, proteomic characterization of vegetative SAFR-032 cells from space-surviving spores is presented in comparison to a ground control. Vegetative cells of the first passage were processed and subjected to quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tags. Approximately 60% of all proteins encoded by SAFR-032 were identified, and 301 proteins were differentially expressed among the strains. We found that proteins predicted to be involved in carbohydrate transport/metabolism and energy production/conversion had lower abundance than those of the ground control. For three proteins, we showed that the expected metabolic activities were decreased, as expected with direct enzymatic assays. This was consistent with a decrease of ATP production in the space-surviving strains. The same space-surviving strains showed increased abundance of proteins related to survival, growth advantage, and stress response. Such alterations in the proteomes provide insights into possible molecular mechanisms of B. pumilus SAFR-032 to adapt to and resist extreme extraterrestrial environments.",

The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suit of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins up-regulated in ISS isolates were involved in oxidative stress response, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. This report provides insight into possible molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment. Lastly, an attempt was made to elucidate plausible causes of the enhanced virulence of both ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains.",

Genomic analyses using EF-1Î± sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically different from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans. However, its effects on the health of immunocompromised humans warrant further study.",

The experiment was conducted with ground control conditions similar to those actually used in spaceflight. Cultures were limited in growth rate due to gas permeable membranes to provide oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange and a lack of agitation to mix the cells throughout the liquid media. Two strains were grown and three biological replicates were completed for each strain. Specific variables (factors) tested were: 1) The effect of UVC (short-wave ultraviolet light) mutagenesis was tested by sampling the algae cultures prior to mutagenesis. 2) The sensitivity of different strains was tested by conducting the experiment with a wild-type and cell wall mutant (cw15) strain. 3) The effect of competitive growth was tested by sampling each biological replicate experiment at the end of each growth cycle. 4) The effect of live culture storage in the dark was tested by sampling each growth cycle twice. At the time of passage, a sample of cells was pelleted and frozen. The cultures were then stored in the dark in a Cargo Transport Bag (CTB) to simulate storage on the ISS and return of cultures. This factor tested whether cultures could be stored alive in the dark or if samples needed to be fixed at the time of passage in order to get an accurate representation of the genetic variation in each cycle of growth. Paired-end, whole genome sequencing was completed for 38 samples: 2 strains pre mutagenesis and 2 strains X 3 biological replicates X 3 growth cycles X 2 storage conditions.",

      "description": "The Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Co. and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space to study the effectiveness of a potential countermeasure for the loss of muscle and bone mass that occurs during spaceflight. Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. Spatially resolved transcriptional profiles were generated from hearts from three flight and three ground control animals as follows. Hearts were cryosectioned longitudinally onto an array of capture probes that bind RNA, fixed, stained and visualized. Heart sections were then permeabilized to release RNA onto the capture probes, and cDNA synthesized on the chip so that its spatial arrangement is encoded within a set of molecular barcodes. cDNA was then released and sequenced. Four to five levels of each heart was analyzed in this manner to allow a 3D reconstruction of the transcriptome. In addition, bulk RNA-seq (ribodepleted, target depth of 60 M clusters, PE 150 bp) was performed from a pool of RNA extracted from 10-20 sections from each of 3 flight and 2 ground control samples.",

      "description": "Physical forces associated with spaceflight and spaceflight analogue culture regulate a wide range of physiological responses by both bacterial and mammalian cells that can impact infection. However, our mechanistic understanding of how these environments regulate host-pathogen interactions in humans is poorly understood. Using a spaceflight analogue low fluid shear culture system, we investigated the effect of Low Shear Modeled Microgravity (LSMMG) culture on the colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in a 3-D biomimetic model of human colonic epithelium containing macrophages. RNA-seq profiling of stationary phase wild type and delta hfq mutant bacteria alone indicated that LSMMG culture induced global changes in gene expression in both strains and that the RNA-binding protein Hfq played a significant role in regulating the transcriptional response of the pathogen to LSMMG culture. However, a core set of genes important for adhesion, invasion, and motility were commonly induced in both strains. LSMMG culture enhanced the colonization (adherence, invasion and intracellular survival) of Salmonella in this advanced model of intestinal epithelium using a mechanism that was independent of Hfq. Although S. Typhimurium delta hfq mutants are normally defective for invasion when grown as conventional shaking cultures, LSMMG conditions unexpectedly enabled high levels of colonization by an isogenic hfq mutant. In response to infection with either the wild type or mutant, host cells upregulated transcripts involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and wound healing during intracellular survival. Interestingly, infection by the hfq mutant led to fewer transcriptional differences between LSMMG- and control-infected host cells relative to infection with the wild type strain. This is the first study to investigate the effect of LSMMG culture on the interaction between S. Typhimurium and a 3-D model of human intestinal tissue. These findings advance our understanding of how physical forces can impact the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis.",

      "description": "While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but that the host immune system is not significantly altered amongst known immune genes. High-throughput sequencing of wild-type (w1118) adult hosts infected with either space or ground-reared S. marcescens revealed few changes in gene expression, with 11 genes significantly differentially expressed (q-values  less than 0.05) and only one gene related to the immune system. This data supports the main findings of the paper, which state that both spaceflight and low-shear modeled microgravity conditions increase the virulence of this pathogen, independent of the host immune system. This data, which shows that there are no significant immune-related changes to the host when infected with space-grown sample compared to ground-grown sample, provides further evidence that there are likely phenotypic changes to the pathogen itself that is causing increased virulence in spaceflight and in low-shear modeled microgravity. RNA was extracted in triplicate from 2 pooled adult (2-3 day old female) Drosophila melanogaster (w1118) per treatment, with 4 total treatment groups (no injection control, sham injection with PBS, ground bacteria-injected, and space bacteria-injected) with poly(A)+ RNA libraries. Samples were multiplexed and sequenced 100bp paired-end ready were sequenced on one lane of the Illumina HiSeq-4000.",

We show that the ISS microbial communities are highly similar to those present in ground-based confined indoor environments and are subject to fluctuations, although a core microbiome persists over time and locations. The genomic and physiological features selected by ISS conditions do not appear to be directly relevant to human health, although adaptations towards biofilm formation and surface interactions were observed.

      "description": "The wild type WS plants and the Sku5 mutant plants in the WS background were germinated on ISS or on the ground and the gene expression profiles in roots at 4 days or 8 days were established. The Sku5 gene (AT4G12420) codes for a multi-copper oxidase-like protein SKU5 protein that is involved in directed root tip growth. The Sku5 protein is glycosylated, GPI-anchored and localizes to the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The Sku5 gene is expressed most strongly in expanding tissues. The development of WS and Sku5 plants on orbit differs from that on the ground as demonstrated by the comparison of the gene expression profiles between 4 days old to 8 days old plant in the two environments. However the development of Sku5 mutant plants also differs from WS at either age and in either environment, suggesting the role of the genetic background in these developmental decisions. The 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit engaged substantially more genes than the 4 days old WS roots in orbit but also more than the 4 days old Sku5 roots on the ground. Overall the 4 days old roots differentially expressed more genes in spaceflight relative to ground than the 8 days old roots of either genotype. Finally, the 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit differ in 862 genes from the 8 days Sku5 roots in orbit while on the ground there is merely half of the number of genes differentially expressed between the 4 days and 8 days developmental stages of the Sku5 roots. APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2) also identified as TAGES-Isa (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression SystemâIntracellular Signaling Architecture) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015. Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates and remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). The plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS with the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. At four or for the second experimental set at eight days, seedlings were harvested by an astronaut into KFT (Kennedy Fixation Tube) containing RNAlater solutions. Upon return to Earth, the harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype and each age using RNAseq technology. The patterns of gene expression was compared between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) within each genotype of same age or between two ages within same genotype and within same treatment. For 4 day old roots 5-8 roots were combined to serve as one biological replica. For 8 day old roots 2-3 roots were used to form one biological replica. In each case the four biological replicas were used for the transcriptomic analysis.",

      "description": "Despite concerns over risks from exposure to low-dose ionizing radiations encountered in the environment and workplace, the molecular consequences of these exposures, particularly at representative doses and dose-rates, remains poorly understood. Using a novel flood source construct, we performed a direct comparison of genome-wide gene expression regulations resulting from exposure of primary human prostate fibroblast cultures to acute (10 cGy and 200 cGy) and longer-term chronic (1.0-2.45 cGy cumulative over 24 h) exposures. Expression profiling showed significant differential regulation of 396 genes with no measureable changes in the acute 10 cGy dose. However, there were 106 genes in common between samples given an acute 200 cGy dose compared to those given chronic doses, most of which were decreased and related to cell cycle or chromosomal movement in M-phase. Biological pathway analysis showed decreases in cell cycle, chromosomal movement, cell survival and DNA replication, recombination and repair as well as a predicted activation of transcriptional regulators TP53, RB1 and CDKN2A. In agreement with these results, prostate epithelial cells given 200 cGy or chronic doses displayed functional decreases in proliferation and mitotic cells. In summary, we showed a contrast to the common observation of constant or reduced effect per unit dose as the dose (acute) was diminished, that even very low total doses delivered chronically could rival the perturbing effect of acute doses 100 times as intense. Underscored is the importance of the means of dose delivery, shown to be as important as dose size when considering biologic effect.",

      "description": "Background: mRNA interactions with each other and other signaling molecules define different biological pathways and functions. Researchers have been investigating various tools to analyze these types of interactions. In particular, gene co-expression network methods have proved useful in finding and analyzing these molecular interactions. Many different analytical pipelines to identify these interactions networks have been proposed with the aim of identifying an optimal partition of the network where the individual modules are neither too small to make any general inference or too large to be biologically interpretable. Results: In this study, we propose a new pipeline to perform gene co-expression network analysis. The proposed pipeline uses WGCNA, a widely used software to perform different aspects of gene co-expression network analysis and modularity maximization algorithm to analyze novel RNA-Seq data to understand the effects of low-dose 56Fe ion irradiation on the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. The network results along with experimental validation show that using WGCNA combined with Modularity provide a more biologically interpretable network in our dataset. Our pipeline showed better performance than the existing clustering algorithm in WGCNA in finding modules and identified a module with mitochondrial subunits that are supported by mitochondrial complex assay. Conclusions: We present a pipeline that can reduce the problem of parameter selection with the existing algorithm in WGCNA for comparable RNA-Seq datasets which may assist in future research to discover novel mRNA interactions and their downstream molecular effects. C57BL16 males were placed into 2 treatment groups and received the following irradiation treatments at Brookhaven National Laboratories (Long Island, NY): 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy), and no irradiation. Left liver lobes were collected at 30, 60, 120, 270, and 360 days post-irradiation, flash frozen and stored at -80Â°C until they could be processed for RNA-Seq. Livers were sampled by taking two 40-micron thick slices using a cryotome at -20Â°C. This allowed multiple sampling of the tissue without the tissue going through multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Total RNA was isolated from the liver slices using RNAqueousTM Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and rRNA was removed via Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to library preparation with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library kit. Samples were sequenced in a paired-end 50 base format on an Illumina HiSeq 1500. Reads were aligned to the mouse GRCm38 reference genome using the STAR alignment program, version 2.5.3a, with the recommended ENCODE options. The -quantMode GeneCounts option was used to obtain read counts per gene based on the Gencode release M14 annotation file. Total number of reads used in analysis varies between 23-35 millions of reads.",

We report the application of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for high-throughput profiling of mRNA in soleus muscle of adult (6 mo) and aged (22-24 mo) mice. Our goal was to determine the effects of hind limb unloading and reloading on mRNA profiles in soleus muscle and compare between adult and aged mice. We find that there are distinct response in the profile of fatty acid oxidation, TCA cycle, ETC oxidative phosphorylation gene expression patterns in response to unloading and reloading.

      "description": "In the 'Rocket Science' citizen science project Eruca sativa (salad rocket) seeds stored for six months on board of the International Space Station caused delayed crop establishment. Here we investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms underpinning the spaceflight effects on dry seeds. We found that 'Space' seed germination vigor was reduced and aging sensitivity increased, but the spaceflight did not compromise seed viability and the development of normal seedlings. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes (using RNASeq) in dry seeds and upon controlled artificial aging treatment (CAAT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with spaceflight and ageing. DEG categories enriched by spaceflight and CAAT included transcription and translation with reduced transcript abundances for 40S and 60S ribosomal subunit genes. Among the 'spaceflight-up' DEGs were Heat Shock Protein (HSP), DNAJ-related chaperones, a Heat Shock Factor (HSFA7a-like), and components of several DNA repair pathways (e.g. ATM, DNA ligase1). The 'response to radiation' category was especially enriched in 'spaceflight-up' DEGs including HSPs, catalases and the transcription factor HY5. The major finding from the physiological and transcriptome analysis is that spaceflight causes vigor loss and partial ageing during air-dry seed storage, for which space environmental factors and consequences for seed storage during spaceflights are discussed.",

      "description": "There is a current interest in the development of biodosimetric methods for rapidly assessing radiation exposure in the wake of a large-scale radiological event. The initial focus of this work has largely centered on determining the exposure dose to an individual using biological indicators. Gene expression signatures are showing promise for biodosimetric application, but little is known about how these signatures might translate for the assessment of radiological injury in radiosensitive individuals, who comprise a significant fraction of the general population, and who would likely require treatment following lower doses. Using Parp1-/- mice as a model radiation sensitive genotype, we have investigated the effect of this DNA repair deficiency on the gene expression response to radiation. Although Parp1 is known to play general roles in regulating transcription, the pattern of gene expression changes observed 24 h after exposure to a potentially lethal LD50 dose of radiation was remarkably similar in the two genotypes, and indicated similar levels of activation of both the p53 and NFÎºB radiation response pathways. In contrast, exposure of wild-type mice to a sub-lethal dose that was equal to the LD50 dose given to the Parp1-/- mice, resulted in a reduced gene expression response. Gene expression classifiers trained on the wild-type data correctly identified all wild-type samples as unexposed, exposed to a sub-lethal dose, or exposed to a potentially lethal dose. All unexposed samples from the Parp1-/- mice were also correctly classified, and 80% of the irradiated samples were identified as exposed to a potentially lethal dose. The results of this study suggest that, at least for some genotypes, gene expression has the potential to accurately detect the extent of radiological injury, rather than being useful only as a surrogate of physical radiation dose.",

To probe the response of its transcriptome to this extreme environment, S. liquefaciens ATCC 27592 was cultivated under 4 different environmental simulations: 0C, 0.7 kPa, CO2 atmosphere (Condition A); 0C, ~101.3 kPa, CO2 atmosphere (Condition B); 0C, ~101.3 kPa, ambient N2/O2 atmosphere (Condition C); and 30C, ~101.3 kPa, N2/O2 atmosphere (Condition D; ambient laboratory conditions). RNA-seq was performed on ribosomal RNA-depleted total RNA isolated from triplicate cultures grown under Conditions A-D and the datasets generated were subjected to transcriptome analyses. The data from Conditions A, B, or C were compared to laboratory Condition D. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts were identified belonging to a number of KEGG pathway categories. Up-regulated genes under all Conditions A, B, and C included those encoding transporters (ABC and PTS transporters); genes involved in translation (ribosomes and their biogenesis, biosynthesis of both tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNAs); DNA repair and recombination; and non-coding RNAs. Genes down-regulated under all Conditions A, B, and C included: transporters (mostly ABC transporters); flagellar and motility proteins; genes involved in phenylalanine metabolism; transcription factors; and two-component systems. The results are discussed in the context of Mars astrobiology and planetary protection.",

      "description": "Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological benefits. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant growth, health, and production. To that end, it is necessary to develop methodologies that investigate the metabolic activities of the plantâs microbiome in orbit to enable rapid responses regarding the care of plants in space. In this study, we developed a protocol to characterize the endophytic and epiphytic microbial metatranscriptome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host-microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results showed that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and effective for rapid on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Taxonomic analysis based on 16S and 18S rRNA transcripts identified that the top five most abundant phyla in the lettuce microbiome were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Ascomycota. The metatranscriptomic analysis identified the expression of genes involved in many metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and signal transduction. Network analyses of the expression data show that, within the signal transduction pathway of the fungal community, the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase signaling pathway was tightly regulated across all samples and could be a potential driver for fungal proliferation. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of using MinION-based metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a method for rapid, on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.",

      "description": "There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n equals 11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts. This dataset derives results from the bone histomorphometry assay.",

Here, we have used mutants from the two nucleolin genes in Arabidopsis (NUC1 and NUC2), encoding the main regulator of the ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, in order to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, while nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light.

Even less is known about plants' response to partial or reduced gravity levels. In the absence of the directional cues provided by the gravity vector, the plant is especially perceptive to other cues such as light. Here, we investigate the response of Arabidopsis thaliana 6-day-old seedlings to microgravity and the Mars partial gravity level during spaceflight, as well as the effects of red light photostimulation by determining meristematic cell growth and proliferation. These experiments involve microscopic techniques together with transcriptomic studies. We demonstrate that microgravity and partial gravity trigger differential responses. The microgravity environment activates hormonal routes responsible for proliferation/growth and upregulates plastid/mitochondrial-encoded transcripts, even in the dark. In contrast, the Mars gravity level inhibits these routes and activates responses to stress factors to restore cell growth parameters only when red photostimulation is provided. This response is accompanied by upregulation of numerous transcription factors such as the environmental acclimation-related WRKY family. In the long term, these discoveries can be applied in the design of bioregenerative life support systems and space farming.",

Consequently, we examined the IgM repertoire of five cosmonauts 25 days before launch, after 64 and 129 days spent on the International Space Station (ISS), and after 1, 7 and 30 days of Earth reambulation using high-throughput sequencing. This is the first study of this kind. Our data revealed that the IgM repertoire of cosmonauts was different from the one of control subjects already prior to launch, and that 2 out the 5 analyzed cosmonauts presented significant changes of their IgM repertoire during the mission. These modifications persisted up to 30 days after landing, likely affected the specificities of IgM binding sites, correlated with changes of the V(D)J recombination process in charge of creating functional antibody genes, and coincided with a higher stress response. These data confirm that about half of the astronauts who spent six months on the ISS are subjected to immunological changes, contribute to explain increased susceptibility to infection, reveal individual responses and consequently that personalized approaches should be implemented during future deep-space exploration missions that will endure for an unprecedented amount of time.",

      "title": "Galactic cosmic radiation induces stable epigenome alterations relevant to human lung cancer",
      "description": "Human deep space and planetary travel is limited by uncertainties regarding the health risks associated with exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), and in particular the high linear energy transfer (LET), heavy ion component. Here we assessed the impact of two high-LET ions 56Fe and 28Si, and low-LET X rays on genome-wide methylation patterns in human bronchial epithelial cells. We found that all three radiation types induced rapid and stable changes in DNA methylation but at distinct subsets of CpG sites affecting different chromatin compartments. The 56Fe ions induced mostly hypermethylation, and primarily affected sites in open chromatin regions including enhancers, promoters and edges ('shores') of CpG islands. The 28Si ion-exposure had mixed effects, inducing both hyper and hypomethylation and affecting sites in more repressed heterochromatic environments, whereas X rays induced mostly hypomethylation, primarily at sites in gene bodies and intergenic regions. Significantly, the methylation status of 56Fe ion irradiation sensitive sites, but not those affected by X ray or 28Si ions, could discriminate tumor from normal tissue for human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, high LET radiation exposure leaves a lasting imprint on the epigenome, and affects sites relevant to human lung cancer. The 56Fe ion signature may prove useful in monitoring the cumulative biological impact and associated cancer risks encountered by astronauts in deep space. Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal human bronchial epithelial cells irradiated with varying doses of 28Si-ion radiation ( 300 MeV/u at 0, 0.3, 1.0 Gy) , 56Fe-ion radiation (600 MeV/u at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 Gy) or X rays (320 kV at 0, 1.0 Gy). Triplicate control and irradiated samples were incubated and sampled at 4 timepoints between 2 and 62 days. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across >485,000 CpGs from collected samples. Samples include: 56Fe ions, 4 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates (4 removed in QC) = 44 samples; 28Si ions = 3 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates = 36 samples; X ray, 2 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates (2 removed in QC)= 22 samples. Overall design: Bisulphite converted DNA from the 102 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.",

      "description": "Plants exhibit a robust transcriptional response to gamma radiation which includes the induction of transcripts required for homologous recombination and the suppression of transcripts that promote cell cycle progression. Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as 'collateral' damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons, on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the 'DSB response' were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing 'extended night.' This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants.",

      "description": "Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stresses, we examined the relevance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we compared the transcriptional responses of wild type and UPR-defective seedlings to spaceflight during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially altered the expression of hundreds of stress related genes compared to ground control conditions. Although many of these genes were differentially regulated in the UPR mutants in the ground control conditions compared to wild type, their expression was largely equalized in all genotypes by flight. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.",

      "description": "One of the health risks posed to astronauts during deep space flights is exposure to high charge, high-energy (HZE) ions (Z>13) which can lead to induction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed comparative RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis to assess the carcinogenic effects of 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy), 1 GeV/n 16O (0.2 Gy), and 350 MeV/n 28Si (0.2 Gy) ions in a mouse model for radiation-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. C3H/HeNCrl mice were subjected to total body irradiation to simulate space HZE-irradiation environment and liver tissues were extracted at five different time points post-irradiation to investigate the time-dependent gradual carcinogenic response at the transcriptomic level. Our data demonstrated a clear difference in the effects of these HZE ions, particularly immunological, on the carcinogenic process of HCC, suggesting different molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Also seen in this study was novel unmapped transcripts that were significantly affected by HZE. To investigate the biological functions of these transcripts, we used a machine learning technique known as self-organizing maps (SOMs) to characterize the transcriptome expression profiles of 60 samples (45 HZE-irradiated, 15 non-irradiated control) from liver tissues. A handful of localized modules in the maps emerged as groups of co-regulated and co-expressed transcripts. The functional context of these modules was discovered using overrepresentation analysis. We found that these spots typically contained enriched populations of transcripts related to specific immunological molecular processes. Taken together, these findings not only led to a better understanding of biological mechanisms underlying risks for HCC after HZE irradiation but also have important implications for discovery of potential countermeasures and identification of biomarkers of HZE-induced HCC.",

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying both mechanosensation and mechanotransduction in osteocytes under the real microgravity (ÂµG) condition are poorly understood. To unravel the mechanisms by which osteocyte, sense and responds to mechanical unloading, we exposed murine osteocytic cell line, Ocy454, seeded on a highly porous polystyrene 3D scaffold, to 2, 4, or 6 days of ÂµG on board the International Space Station (ISS) and compared their gene expression with cells at 1G on Earth.

Under the Rodent Research Program of NASA, we assayed the genomic and metabolomics perturbations in the quadriceps of C57BL/6J male mice that lived on the spaceflight (FLT) or at Ground Control (CTR) for approximately four weeks. Wet weight of quadriceps were significantly reduced in FLT mice. Deep next generation sequencing and untargeted mass spectroscopic assay interrogated the gene-metabolite landscape of same tissues. A majority of top ranked differentially suppressed genes in FLT encode proteins from myosin or troponin family suggesting a sarcomere alteration in space. Significantly enriched gene-metabolite networks were found linked to saromeric integrity, immune fitness and oxidative stress response; all inhibited in space as per in silico prediction. A significant loss of FLT mitochondrial DNA copy numbers underlined the energy deprivation associated with spaceflight induced stress, and this hypothesis was reinforced by the omics analysis that showed inhibited networks related to protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Finally, we reported a list of upstream regulators, which could be targeted for next generation therapeutic intervention for the betterment of the musculoskeletal system in male mice subjected to chronic disuse.

Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), encodes a large protein with a phosph@idylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like domain at the C terminus (reviewed by Rotman and Shiloh, 1998). PI3K-related proteins make up a large family of Ser-Thr protein kinases, numerous members of which are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, responses to DNA damage, and the maintenance of genomic stability (Hoekstra, 1997). AtATM plays an essential role in meiosis and in the somatic response to DNA damage in plants, similar to the function of ATM in mammals and other eukaryotes.

      "description": "Adaptation of humans in low gravity conditions is a matter of utmost importance when efforts are on to a gigantic leap in human space expeditions for tourism and formation of space colonies. In this connection, cardiovascular adaptation in low gravity is a critical component of human space exploration. Deep high-throughput sequencing approach allowed us to analyze the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cultured under gravity (G), and stimulated microgravity (MG) achieved with a clinostat. The present study identified totally 1870 miRNAs differentially expressed in HUVEC under MG condition when compared to the cells subjected to unitary G conditions. The functional association of identified miRNAs targeting specific mRNAs revealed that miRNAs, hsa-mir-496, hsa-mir-151a, hsa-miR-296-3p, hsa-mir-148a, hsa-miR-365b-5p, hsa-miR-3687, hsa-mir-454, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-145-5p differentially regulated the genes involved in cell adhesion, angiogenesis, cell cycle, JAK-STAT signaling, MAPK signaling, nitric oxide signaling, VEGF signaling, and wound healing pathways. Further, the q-PCR based experimental studies of upregulated and downregulated miRNA and mRNAs demonstrate that the above reported miRNAs influence the cell proliferation and vascular functions of the HUVEC in MG conditions effectively. Consensus on the interactome results indicates restricted fluctuations in the transcriptome of the HUVEC exposed to short-term MG that could lead to higher levels of endothelial functions like angiogenesis and vascular patterning.",

      "description": "Biological risks associated with space radiation and microgravity are major concerns for long-term space travel. Through a Systems Biology approach, our previous NASA work has shown both TGFÃÂ² signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We investigated this hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro and test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach was used to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR), we used the ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To simulate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE), we used an acute dose of SPE simulated beam at 1Gy which has energies ranging from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were utilized for irradiation with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions will also be irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data, we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing on serum (before IR and at time of sacrifice), liver, heart, and muscle tissue for all radiation groups revealed the key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting disease risk. Collectively, understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.",

      "description": "Cancer-causing genome instability is a major concern during space travel due to exposure of astronauts to potent sources of high-linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are particularly susceptible to genotoxic stress, and accumulation of damage can lead to HSC dysfunction and oncogenesis. Our group recently demonstrated that aging human HSCs accumulate microsatellite instability coincident with loss of MLH1, a DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) protein, which could reasonably predispose to radiation-induced HSC malignancies. Therefore, in an effort to reduce risk uncertainty for cancer development during deep space travel, we employed an Mlh1+/- mouse model to study the effects high-LET 56Fe ion space-like radiation. Irradiated Mlh1+/- mice showed a significantly higher incidence of lymphomagenesis with 56Fe ions compared to ÃÂ³-rays and unirradiated mice, and malignancy correlated with increased MSI in the tumors. In addition, whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed high SNVs and INDELs in lymphomas being driven by loss of Mlh1 and frequently mutated genes had a strong correlation with human leukemias. Therefore, the data suggest that age-related MMR deficiencies could lead to HSC malignancies after space radiation, and that countermeasure strategies will be required to adequately protect the astronaut population on the journey to Mars.",

      "description": "Among the physiological consequences of extended spaceflight are loss of skeletal muscle and bone mass. One signaling pathway that plays an important role in maintaining muscle and bone homeostasis is that regulated by the secreted signaling proteins, myostatin (MSTN) and activin A. Here, we used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the effect of targeting MSTN/activin A signaling in mice that were sent to the International Space Station. Wild type mice lost significant muscle and bone mass during the 33 d spent in microgravity. Muscle weights of Mstn -/- mice, which are about twice those of wild type mice, were largely maintained during spaceflight. Systemic inhibition of MSTN/activin A signaling using a soluble form of the activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B), which can bind each of these ligands, led to dramatic increases in both muscle and bone mass, with effects being comparable in ground and flight mice. Exposure to microgravity and treatment with the soluble receptor each led to alterations in numerous signaling pathways, which were reflected in changes in levels of key signaling components in the blood as well as their RNA expression levels in muscle and bone. These findings have implications for therapeutic strategies to combat the concomitant muscle and bone loss occurring in people afflicted with disuse atrophy on Earth as well as in astronauts in space, especially during prolonged missions.",

These data consist of hundreds of samples flown in space, human metrics from 59 astronauts, and confirmatory data from NASAâs Twin Study, analyzed together for consistent transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic response to spaceflight. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of mitochondrial activity and innate immunity. Muscle and liver tissues showed that chronic inflammation, may be a response to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additional pathways altered in spaceflight included cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory activity pathways, all of which are known to have interactions with mitochondrial activity. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, all of which indicate mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight.",

Consequently, we used advanced proteomics analysis of femur bone and marrow of mice flown for one month on board the BION-M1 biosatellite, to determine whether extreme conditions encountered during a real spaceflight affect B cell development in mice and to examine reversibility of the effects upon return to Earth. Our data revealed that adverse effects on B lymphopoiesis were more marked one week after landing and that this phenomenon was associated with a 41% reduction of B cells in the spleen. Thus, the effects of spaceflight persisted during at least one week after landing. These reductions may contribute to explain increased susceptibility to infection even if we confirmed that animals were able to mount a humoral immune response.",

      "description": "Canton S laboratory wildtype lines (Bloomington Stock Center) and a K+ channel mutant seizure (seizurets1, a gift from Dr. Barry Ganetsky, published in Titus et al., 1997), a homolog of human hERG, were used in this study. Flies launched to the International Space Station and the corresponding ground controls were housed in polystyrene vials (75 x24 mm) with 10 ml of standard cornmeal-based fly food containing double the usual amount of 10% Tegosept and cellulose acetate plugs. Approximately 24 hours prior to launch, 15 vials were each loaded with 10 virgin females and 5 male adult flies. Loaded vials were placed in a Plexiglas tray and inserted into a vented fly box (VFB), a modified version of a Nanoracks box. The VFB was placed into a canvas case for loading into the Dragon capsule. Launch of SpaceX CRS-3 occurred at 19:25 UTC on April 18, 2014. Flies were kept in the VFB throughout the 30-day mission and were stored aboard the docked Dragon capsule that shared atmosphere with the ISS. The Dragon capsule unberthed at 13:26 UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) on May 18, 2014 and re-entry into the Earthâs atmosphere occurred the same day at 19:05 UTC. Following retrieval of the Dragon capsule off the coast of Mexico, the VFB was offloaded at Long Beach Port, California and transported by car to La Jolla, California in a climate-controlled vehicle. Surviving adult flies born on the ISS were collected from the vials at 23:30 UTC on May 20, 2014. Data collection, which included negative geotaxis assays, heart function studies, tissue collection for RNAseq, and tissue preservation for immunohistochemistry, was completed by 07:30 UTC on May 21, 2014 on all microg spaceflown and corresponding ground control flies. The VFB was oriented such that the gâload was directed down into the food supply located at the bottom of the vials. This orientation was maintained throughout the entirety of the mission, from point of transfer at the lab at NASA Kennedy Space Center through stowage on the Dragon capsule, and again from Dragon un-berthing to opening of the VFB in the lab at SBP Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. Ground control flies were prepared and reared under identical conditions in ground-based incubators with temperature and humidity controlled to levels recorded on the ISS.",

      "description": "This study investigated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, density and microarchitecture in weight bearing (femur and humerus) and non-weight bearing (2nd) lumbar vertebra and calvarium) bones in the context of ovarian hormone insufficiency. 12-week-old Fisher 344 rats were ovariectomized 2 weeks before flight and randomized into one of three groups: 1) baseline (n equals 6), 2) ground control (n equals 12) or 3) spaceflight (n equals 12). Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats provided age-matched reference values at baseline (n equals 8) and landing (n equals 10). Ovariectomy resulted in bone- and bone compartment-specific deficits in cancellous bone volume fraction. Spaceflight resulted in lower cortical bone accrual in the femur but had no effect on cortical bone in the humerus or calvarium. Cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to ground control animals in lumbar vertebra and distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis; significant differences were not detected in the distal humerus. Bone loss (compared to baseline controls) in the femur metaphysis was associated with lower trabecular number, whereas trabecular thickness and number were lower in the epiphysis. This dataset is only for the ovariectomized animals. In summary, the effect of spaceflight on bone microarchitecture in ovariectomized rats was bone-and bone compartment-specific but not strictly related to weight bearing. This dataset derives results from the microâcomputed tomography (mCT) assay.",

      "description": "The Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Co. and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space to study the effectiveness of a potential countermeasure for the loss of muscle and bone mass that occurs during spaceflight. Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, and matching sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. Brain samples from three flight and three ground control animal groups were cut in half between hemispheres. One hemisphere of each brain was used for generating spatially resolved transcriptional profiling data. Hemispheres were cryosectioned so that 2 consecutive sections from the hippocampus of each brain was placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays. Samples were fixed, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging was followed by tissue permeabilization to release mRNA molecules from cells for capture onto the array surface. Subsequently, following the 10XGenomics Visium Gene Expression protocol, Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq libraries were prepared and sequenced. The other hemisphere of each brain was used for single nuclei RNA-seq and ATAC-seq using the 10X Multiome protocol. In addition, bulk RNA-seq (ribodepleted, target depth of 60 M clusters, PE 150 bp) was performed from a pool of RNA extracted from 10-20 sections from each of 3 flight and 3 ground control samples.",

      "description": "The annotation of the Affymetrix HTA 2.0 array was updated to optimise the detection of RNA in human skeletal muscle biopsy samples by removing invalid and low signal-high-variance probes (as for CDF GPL24047). The probes were then summarized into groups (probe-sets) reflecting either an ensembl full transcript identifier (FL-ENST, GPL24047) or just the probes targeting the 3' UTR or the 5' UTR of that particular ENST. Therefore, 3 different CDF were used to process the HTA 2.0 arrays in this study. Note that each CEL file was GC adjusted using APT while our custom CDF pipeline removes any probe that has >80% or <20% GC content (~50,000). The analysis was carried out only on the pairs of probe-sets i.e. FL-ENST vs 3'UTR or FL-ENST vs 5'UTR or 3'UTR vs 5'UTR. Dynamic muscle loading alters tissue phenotype reflecting altered metabolic and functional demands. In humans, heterogeneous adaptation to loading complicates identification of the underpinning molecular regulators. We present a within-person analysis strategy that reduced heterogeneity for changes in muscle mass by ~40% and employed a genome-wide transcriptome method that modeled each mRNA from coding exons and 3â/5â untranslated (UTR) regions. Our strategy detected ~3-4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized studies, including substantial UTR-selective regulation that other methods would not detect. We discovered a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth validated from newly analyzed independent samples (n=100). Further validating these identified genes, via RNAi in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis e.g. Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans MoTrPAC. Employing proteome-constrained networks and pathway analysis revealed notable relationships with the molecular characteristics of human muscle aging and insulin sensitivity, as well as potential drug-therapies.",

      "description": "For long-duration space missions, it is critical to maintain health-associated homeostasis between astronauts and their microbiome. To achieve this goal it is important to more fully understand the hostâsymbiont relationship under the physiological stress conditions of spaceflight. To address this issue we examined the impact of a spaceflight analog, low-shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG), on the transcriptome of the mutualistic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Cultures of V. fischeri and a mutant defective in the global regulator Hfq (âhfq) were exposed to either LSMMG or gravity conditions for 12âh (exponential growth) and 24âh (stationary phase growth). Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed few to no significant differentially expressed genes between gravity and the LSMMG conditions in the wild type or mutant V. fischeri at exponential or stationary phase. There was, however, a pronounced change in transcriptomic profiles during the transition between exponential and stationary phase growth in both V. fischeri cultures including an overall decrease in gene expression associated with translational activity and an increase in stress response. There were also several upregulated stress genes specific to the LSMMG condition during the transition to stationary phase growth. The âhfq mutants exhibited a distinctive transcriptome profile with a significant increase in transcripts associated with flagellar synthesis and transcriptional regulators under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls. These results indicate the loss of Hfq significantly influences gene expression under LSMMG conditions in a bacterial symbiont. Together, these results improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which microgravity alters the physiology of beneficial host-associated microbes.",

Immune regulation is known to be impacted and it remains to be seen whether prolonged effects will be encountered in deep space that can have an adverse impact on health. In this study we investigated the effects in overall metabolism of three different low dose radiation exposures (Î³-rays, 16O, and 56Fe) in spleen from male C57BL/6 mice at 1, 2, and 4 months after exposure. Forty metabolites were identified with significant enrichment in purine metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and amino acids. Early perturbations were more prominent in the Î³ irradiated samples, while longer term responses shifted towards the high energy particle effects. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation of fatty acids with time and negative association with Î³-rays, while degradation of purines were positively associated with time. Taken together, there is a strong suggestion of mitochondrial implication and the possibility of long term effects in DNA repair and nucleotide pools following radiation exposure.",

      "description": "Biosynthesis of many ecologically important secondary metabolites (SMs) in filamentous fungi is controlled by several global transcriptional regulators, like the chromatin modifier LaeA, and tied to both development and vegetative growth. In Aspergillus molds, asexual development is regulated by the BrlA  AbaA  WetA transcriptional cascade. To elucidate BrlA pathway involvement in SM regulation, we examined the transcriptional and metabolic profiles of ÎbrlA, ÎabaA, and ÎwetA mutant and wild-type strains of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We find that BrlA, in addition to regulating production of developmental SMs, regulates vegetative SMs and the SrbA-regulated hypoxia stress response in a concordant fashion to LaeA. We further show that the transcriptional and metabolic equivalence of the ÎbrlA and ÎlaeA mutations is mediated by an LaeA requirement preventing heterochromatic marks in the brlA promoter. These results provide a framework for the cellular network regulating not only fungal SMs but diverse cellular processes linked to virulence of this pathogen. IMPORTANCE Filamentous fungi produce a spectacular variety of small molecules, commonly known as secondary or specialized metabolites (SMs), which are critical to their ecologies and lifestyles (e.g., penicillin, cyclosporine, and aflatoxin). Elucidation of the regulatory network that governs SM production is a major question of both fundamental and applied research relevance. To shed light on the relationship between regulation of development and regulation of secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi, we performed global transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses on mutant and wild-type strains of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus under conditions previously shown to induce the production of both vegetative growth-specific and asexual development-specific SMs. We find that the gene brlA, previously known as a master regulator of asexual development, is also a master regulator of secondary metabolism and other cellular processes. We further show that brlA regulation of SM is mediated by laeA, one of the master regulators of SM, providing a framework for the cellular network regulating not only fungal SMs but diverse cellular processes linked to virulence of this pathogen.",

      "description": "This study analyzes the variability of responses to simulated deep space radiation among 15 commonly used mouse strains. Ex vivo primary skin fibroblast responses to high mass-high charge particles and X-rays were analyzed by quantifying DNA damage-sensing protein 53BP1 positive radiation-induced foci (RIF) as a surrogate biomarker of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from 10 collaborative cross strains and five reference inbred mice (C57Bl/6, BALB/CByJ, B6C3, C3H and CBA/CaJ) and exposed to 350 MeV/n Ar and 600 MeV/n Fe particles as well as X-rays. Our results indicate that nearby DSBs coalesced into repair units characterized by large RIFs. Such model has the advantage of being much more efficient molecularly, but is poorly suited to deal with cosmic radiation, where energy is concentrated along the particle trajectory. Thus, we observed a large density of DSBs along each particle track and the percentage of unrepaired DSBs that increased with linear energy transfer of the particle over 48 hours post irradiation. Furthermore, persistent RIF levels ex vivo were well correlated with T and B lymphocyte survival in vivo in 10 collaborative cross strains 24 hours after 0.1 Gy whole-body dose of X-rays, suggesting that persistent RIFs might serve as an ex vivo biomarker for in vivo radiation toxicity. Finally, we performed genome-wide association study to identify the genomic associations with dose responses to ionizing radiation, marked as Foci per Gray (FPG), as well as with background DNA repair levels (BGD). This dataset includes GWAS data as well as FPG and BGD values for each sample and condition.",

      "description": "Ionizing radiation (IR) not only affects cells that are directly irradiated but also their non-irradiated neighbors, which show responses known as bystander effects. While bystander and direct responses have several common end points including apoptosis and micronucleation, chromatin remodeling and altered levels or activities of regulatory proteins, they can be quantitatively and qualitatively different. The majority of studies of radiation bystander effects have utilized 2-dimensional in vitro systems, but we have recently demonstrated such effects in EPI-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), a 3-dimensional tissue model that precisely imitates the structure and function of human epidermis. Global gene expression is a powerful tool for uncovering both fundamental signaling processes and the mechanistic basis of cellular or physiological effects. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in bystander cells located at 0.125 and 0.625 um from the irradiation line, in 16h after irradiation. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further network analysis was performed with IPA (Ingenuity). Significantly responding genes were identified at the both distances. For instance, all sets demonstrated upregulation of two key enzymes of the lipid biosynthesis, UGT1 and PITPNB, and downregulation of proapoptotic proteins: BAX and ARHGEF5. In contrast, several proteins involved in transcriptional repression (CHD6, CHD8 andWRNIP1) were strongly upregulated suggesting a rearrangement in the gene transcription. These changes suggest an activation of bystander mechanisms different from those observed in 2-dimensional cell cultures. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 0.5 Gy of alpha-particles. Three independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-625 and 625-1125 um) using three tissue fragments per a data point.",

By comparing irradiated tissues with non-irradiated control, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses and reveal the affected biological pathways and molecular functions. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis was performed with Panther database (Applied Biosystems). Gene ontology analysis of the samples harvested in 16h after exposure showed that irradiation presumably affected the genes involved in cell-cell signaling (15 genes, , p=9.0 x E-04) ion transport (10 genes, p=0.00189) and amino acid metabolism (5 genes, p=0.0258). Among 16 genes differentially expressed in 1h after exposure we found NOTCH2 (ENST00000401649) and methyltransferase AOF1 (KDM1B). In the mammalian cells, NOTCH signaling pathway has a role in differentiation and intracellular communication. Moreover the intercellular domain of NOTCH regulates gene expression acting as a transcription factor. In turn, AOF1 affects the transcription via histone demethylation. Thus, irradiation with alpha-particles caused predominant downregulation of multiple genes in 1 and 16h after exposure. It also suggested that changes in cell metabolism initially affected transcriptional regulation and finally led to the rearrangement in expression of genes playing a role in biosynthesis and ion trafficking. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 1 and 16 h hours after exposure to 0.5 Gy of alpha-particles.

Receptors (12 genes, p=0.0467), including nuclear hormone receptors (3 genes, p=8.2 x E-04) and Ser/Thr receptors (3 genes, p=5.3 x E-03), chemokines (2 genes, p=0.0155) and signaling molecules were overrepresented among 123 upregulated genes while DNA binding proteins (27 genes, p=5.07 x E-04), particularly helicases (6 genes, p=3.61 x E-03) and, G-protein modulators (16 genes, p=4.4 x E-03) were overrepresented among 403 downregulated genes. Remarkably, 6 differentially regulated genes in this group were represented by helicases and methyltransferases (6 genes, p=0. 0534) involved in methylation of histones and DNA. These changes confirmed an importance in the biological response of two its basic components: receptor-regulated pathways and chromatin remodeling. Upregulation the first group supposes to increase sensitivity of irradiated cells to chemokines and cytokines while downregulation of the second group would likely affect the DNA methylation pattern and stimulate the transcription.

      "description": "Physical inactivity is a risk factor for insulin resistance. We examined the effect of nine days of bed rest on basal and insulin stimulated expression of genes potentially involved in insulin action by applying hypothesis-generating microarray in parallel with candidate gene real-time PCR approaches in 20 healthy, young men. Furthermore, we investigated whether bed rest affected DNA methylation in the promoter region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) gene. Subjects were re-examined after four weeks of retraining. Findings: Bed rest induced insulin resistance and altered the expression of more than 4,500 genes. These changes were only partly normalized after four weeks of retraining. Pathway analyses revealed significant down-regulation of 34 pathways, predominantly those of genes associated with mitochondrial function including PPARGC1A. Despite induction of insulin resistance, bed rest resulted in a paradoxically increased response to acute insulin in the general expression of genes, particularly those involved in inflammation and endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, bed rest changed gene expressions of several insulin resistance and diabetes candidate genes. We also observed a trend toward increased PPARGC1A DNA methylation after bed rest. Conclusions: Impaired expression of PPARGC1A and other genes involved in mitochondrial function as well as a paradoxically increased response to insulin of genes involved in inflammation and ER stress may contribute to the development of insulin resistance induced by bed rest. Lack of complete normalization of changes after four weeks of exercise retraining underscores the importance of maintaining a minimum of daily physical activity.",

We assessed whether this response is specific and prolonged and is linked to epigenetic mechanisms. We focused on the response of the hippocampus at early (2-weeks) and late (20-week) time points following whole body proton irradiation. We examined two forms of DNA methylation, cytosine methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC). Impairments in object recognition, spatial memory retention, and network stability following proton irradiation were observed at the two-week time point and correlated with altered gene expression and 5hmC profiles that mapped to specific gene ontology pathways. Significant overlap was observed between DNA methylation changes at the 2 and 20-week time points demonstrating specificity and retention of changes in response to radiation. Moreover, a novel class of DNA methylation change was observed following an environmental challenge (i.e. space irradiation), characterized by both increased and decreased 5hmC levels along the entire gene body. These changes were mapped to genes encoding neuronal functions including postsynaptic gene ontology categories. Thus, the brain's response to proton irradiation is both specific and prolonged and involves novel remodeling of non-random regions of the epigenome.",

      "description": "Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, an endospore-forming bacterial strain, was investigated to determine its methylation pattern (methylome) change, compared to ground control, after direct exposure to space conditions onboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 1.5 years. The resulting ISS-flown and non-flown strains were sequenced using the Nanopore MinION and an in-house method and pipeline to identify methylated positions in the genome. Our analysis indicated genomic variants and m6A methylation increased in the ISS-flown SAFR-032. To complement the broader omics investigation and explore phenotypic changes, ISS-flown and non-flown strains were compared in a series of laboratory-based chamber experiments using an X-ray irradiation source (doses applied at 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 Gy); results show a potentially higher survival fraction of ISS-flown DS2 at the two highest exposures. Taken together, results from this study document lasting changes to the genome by methylation, potentially triggered by conditions in spaceflight, with functional consequences for the resistance of bacteria to stressors expected on long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit.",

      "description": "Adverse effects of spaceflight on musculoskeletal health increase the risk of bone injury and impairment of fracture healing. Its yet elusive molecular comprehension warrants immediate attention, since space travel is becoming more frequent. Here we examined the effects of spaceflight on bone fracture healing using a 2â¯mm femoral segmental bone defect (SBD) model. Forty, 9-week-old, male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into 4 groups: 1) Sham surgery on Ground (G-Sham); 2) Sham surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Sham); 3) SBD surgery on Ground (G-Surgery); and 4) SBD surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Surgery). Surgery procedures occurred 4â¯days prior to launch; post-launch, the spaceflight mice were house in the rodent habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) for approximately 4â¯weeks before euthanasia. Mice remaining on the Earth were subjected to identical housing and experimental conditions. The right femur from half of the spaceflight and ground groups was investigated by micro-computed tomography (ÂµCT). In the remaining mice, the callus regions from surgery groups and corresponding femoral segments in sham mice were probed by global transcriptomic and metabolomic assays. ÂµCT confirmed escalated bone loss in FLT-Sham compared to G-Sham mice. Comparing to their respective on-ground counterparts, the morbidity gene-network signal was inhibited in sham spaceflight mice but activated in the spaceflight callus. ÂµCT analyses of spaceflight callus revealed increased trabecular spacing and decreased trabecular connectivity. Activated apoptotic signals in spaceflight callus were synchronized with inhibited cell migration signals that potentially hindered the wound site to recruit growth factors. A major pro-apoptotic and anti-migration gene network, namely the RANK-NFÎºB axis, emerged as the central node in spaceflight callus. Concluding, spaceflight suppressed a unique biomolecular mechanism in callus tissue to facilitate a failed regeneration, which merits a customized intervention strategy.

      "description": "We sought to comprehensively elucidate the transcriptomic underpinnings of microgravity-induced muscle phenotypes in mice by evaluating both differential gene expression (DGE) and changes in alternative splicing (AS) due to extended spaceflight. Total RNA was isolated from the gastrocnemius and quadriceps, postural and phasic muscles of the hind limb, respectively, of 32-week-old female BALB/c mice exposed to microgravity or ground control conditions for nine weeks. RNA sequencing revealed that DGE and AS varied across postural and phasic muscle types with preferential employment of DGE in the gastrocnemius and AS in the quadriceps. Gene ontology analysis indicated that DGE and AS regulate distinct molecular processes. Various non-differentially expressed transcripts encoding musculoskeletal proteins (Tnnt3, Tnnt1, Neb, Ryr1, and Ttn) and muscle-specific RNA binding splicing regulators (Mbnl1 and Rbfox1) were found to have significant changes in AS that altered critical functional domains of their protein products. In striking contrast, microgravity-induced differentially expressed genes were associated with translation/ribosomal function and lipid metabolism. Our work serves as the first comprehensive investigation of coordinate changes in DGE and AS in large limb muscles across spaceflight. We propose that substantial remodeling of pre-mRNA by AS is a major component of transcriptomic adaptation of skeletal muscle to microgravity. The alternatively spliced genes identified here could be targeted by small molecule splicing regulator therapies to address microgravity-induced changes in muscle during spaceflight.",

      "description": "The increasing availability of flights on suborbital rockets creates new avenues for the study of spaceflight effects on biological systems, in particular the transitions between hypergravity and microgravity. This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3Îº:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3Îº:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight. Multiple genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were flown on either the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo (VG VP-03; Col-0 and WS) or Blue Origin New Shepard (BO NS-12; WS and sku5) suborbital flight platforms. Plates containing the seedlings, 10 days and 11 days old in VG and BO, respectively, were wrapped in Duvetyn Black-Out cloth and mounted to the internal wall of the FLEX imaging system payload used in these flights. Gene expression was compared between the ground control and spaceflight-exposed seedlings via RNA-Seq analysis of extracted total RNA from the roots of these seedlings",

      "description": "One of the most likely risks astronauts on long duration space missions face is exposure to ionizing radiation associated with highly energetic and charged heavy (HZE) particles. Since access to medical expertise on such a mission is limited at best, early diagnosis and mitigation of such exposure is critical. In order to accurately determine the time since exposure and dosage of exposure, dose- and time-dependent biomarkers are needed. Therefore, we performed a dose- and time-course transcriptional analysis for radiation exposure at 0, 0.15, 0.30, and 1.5 Gy with corresponding time points at 1 hour (hr)post-exposure as well as 2 hr and 6 hr using Affymetrix Human PrimeArray chips. The analysis of our data suggests a set of sensitive genetic biomarkers specific to each radiation level as well as generic radiation response biomarkers. Upregulated biomarkers can then be used within lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems to detect exposure to ionizing radiation. Overall design: A total of 100 human samples representing radiation exposure at levels 0 Gy, 0.15 Gy, 0.30 Gy and 1.5 Gy at time points 1 hour (hr), 2 hr, and 6 hr post-exposure were constructed. Blood samples were extracted from ten human volunteers, and were irradiated. Leukocytes were extracted, and gene expression was measured. Samples for all ten volunteers were measured at 1 hr and 2 hr for all four dose levels, while samples from volunteers 1,2,3,4, and 7 were measured at 6 hr, resulting in 10 replicates at 1 hr and 2 hr for each dosage, and 5 replicates at 6 hr post-exposure. Thus, a total of 25 samples at each of the four radiation levels were sampled, yielding the total of 100 samples.",

      "description": "Microgravity impacts various aspects of human health. Yet the mechanisms of spaceflight-induced health problems are not elucidated. Here we mapped the fusion systemic analysis of the serum metabolome and the circulating microRNAome in a hindlimb unloading rat model to simulate microgravity. The response of serum metabolites and microRNAs to simulated microgravity (SMG) was striking. Integrated pathway analysis of altered serum metabolites and target genes of the significantly altered circulating miRNAs with Integrated Molecular Pathway-Level Analysis (IMPaLA) software was mainly suggestive of modulation of neurofunctional signaling pathways. Particularly, we revealed significantly increased miR-383-5p and decreased aquaporin 4 (AQP4) - in the hippocampus. Utilizing Rabies Virus Glycoprotein (RVG)-modified exosomes, delivery of miR-383-5p inhibited the expression of AQP4 not only in rat C6 glioma cells in vitro but also in the hippocampus in vivo. Using bioinformatics to map the crosstalk between the circulating metabolome and miRNAome could offer opportunities to understand complex biological systems under microgravity. Our present results suggested that the change of miR-383-5p level and its regulation of target gene AQP4 was one of the potential molecular mechanisms of microgravity induced cognitive impairment in the hippocampus. MiRNA plays an important role during the adaptation to microgavity. In this study, effects of simulated microgravity on circulating microRNA profiles were performed to screen different expression miRNA and gravity-sensitive miRNAs. To investigate the influence of simulated microgravity on the circulating miRNAome, the male SD rats were randomly assigned to the control group or the hindlimb unloading group to simulated microgravity for 28 days under 12hr light/12hr dark schedule. Total miRNA was extracted form Serum and used for miRNA microarray analysis with 3 pooled control samples and 4 pooled Hindlimb suspension simulated microgravity samples (each pool was composed of 4 individual serum samples with the same volume).",

Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight onboard the International Space Station (ISS), show stress-related transcriptomic changes most notably associated with pathogen stress response. Here, we investigate how known terrestrial stress associated epigenetic modulations might play a role in spaceflight adaptation. To examine the role of 5mCyt in spaceflight adaptation, the APEX04-EPEX experiment conducted onboard the ISS evaluated the spaceflight altered genome wide methylation profiles of two methylation regulating gene mutants, methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5), that are involved in pathogen defense response, along with a wild type Col-0 control. MethylSeq and RNAseq analyses were performed on both spaceflight grown samples and ground grown controls. In addition, the epigenetics effects that may contribute to the differential gene expression patterns observed between leaf and root tissues were also investigated in an organ-specific manner.",

The NASA led Rodent Research 5 mission enabled an ancillary investigation of the gut microbiome varying exposure to microgravity (flight) relative to ground controls in the context of previously shown bone mineral density (BMD) loss that was observed in these flight groups. We demonstrate elevated abundance of Lactobacillus murinus and Dorea sp. during microgravity exposure relative to ground control through whole genome sequencing and 16S rRNA analyses. Specific functionally assigned gene clusters of Lactobacillus murinus and Dorea sp. capable of producing metabolites, lactic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and glutathione are enriched. These metabolites are elevated in the microgravity-exposed host serum through LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis. Along with BMD loss, ELISA analysis reveals increases of osteocalcin and reductions in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b signifying additional loss of bone homeostasis in flight.",

To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 38-day old male Sprague-Dawley rats were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 10/18/1993 and housed in Research Animal Housing Facility (RAHF) on the shuttle for 14 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown, the FLT were decapitated, and dissection occurred on 11/1/1993. Asynchronous ground control animals (GC) were exposed identical environmental conditions as the FLT group except for noise profile, acceleration and vibration. GC animals were housed in SpaceLab-3 (SL-3) simulated cages and dissection occurred on 11/1/1993.  Upon dissection, thymus tissues were preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 C before RNA was extracted.  This dataset features 6 FLT and 6 GC biological replicates.  In preparation for RNA extraction, thymus tissues were prepared by generating wedge cuts from the top and bottom of the tissue, designated as Cut1 and Cut2.  RNA was then extracted from both sets of cuts for all samples.  For all FLT and GC samples, purified RNA from Cut2 was selected for library construction.  Additionally, purified RNA from Cut1 was also selected for library construction for only one FLT and one GC sample, FLT_F15_Cut1 and GC_G12_Cut1, respectively, which also included four technical replicates (LibRep1-4).  All libraries were generated using the QIAseq UPX 3â Transcriptome kit that enables 3â gene expression analysis from purified RNA and sequenced around 40 M clusters at SE 93 bp.",

      "title": "Cerium oxide nanoparticle administration to skeletal muscle cells under different gravity and radiation conditions",
      "description": "For their remarkable biomimetic properties implying strong modulation of the intracellular and extracellular redox state, cerium oxide nanoparticles (also termed 'nanoceria') were hypothesized to exert a protective role against oxidative stress associated to the harsh environmental conditions of spaceflight, characterized by microgravity and highly energetic radiations. Nanoparticles were supplied to proliferating C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells under different gravity and radiation levels (microgravity+cosmic radiations or Earth gravity+cosmic radiations on board the International Space Station; Earth gravity on ground). Biological responses were thus investigated at a transcriptional level by RNA next-generation sequencing. Lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were generated and intersected by taking into consideration relevant comparisons, which led to the observation of prevailing effects of the space environment over those induced by nanoceria, possibly due to its administration during spaceflight. In space, up-regulation of transcription was slightly preponderant over down-regulation, and it implied involvement of intracellular compartments, with the majority of DEGs being consistently over- or under-expressed whenever present. Cosmic radiations regulated a higher number of DEGs than microgravity and seemed to promote increased cellular catabolism. By taking into consideration space physical stressors alone, microgravity and cosmic radiations appeared to have opposite effects at transcriptional level despite partial sharing of molecular pathways. Interestingly, gene ontology denoted some enrichment in terms related to vision, when only effects of radiation were assessed. The regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 in space-relevant samples suggests perturbation of the intracellular redox homeostasis, and leaves open opportunities to antioxidant treatment for oxidative stress reduction in harsh environments. RNA-seq/miRNA-seq of C2C12 proliferating mouse myoblasts, cultured in the following conditions (n of 3): A (without nanoceria, in space without gravity), B (with nanoceria, in space without gravity), C (without nanoceria, in space with gravity), D (with nanoceria, in space with gravity), E (without nanoceria, on land), and F (with nanoceria, on land).",

Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight onboard the International Space Station (ISS), show stress-related transcriptomic changes most notably associated with pathogen stress response. Here, we investigate how known terrestrial stress associated epigenetic modulations might play a role in spaceflight adaptation. To examine the role of 5mCyt in spaceflight adaptation, the APEX04-EPEX experiment conducted onboard the ISS evaluated the spaceflight altered genome wide methylation profiles of two methylation regulating gene mutants (methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5) that are involved in pathogen defense response, along with a wild type Col-0 control. MethylSeq and RNAseq analyses were performed on both spaceflight grown samples and ground grown controls. In addition, the epigenetics effects that may contribute to the differential gene expression patterns observed between leaf and root tissues were also investigated in an organ-specific manner.",

This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3Îº:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3Îº:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms.

      "description": "Microgravity and space radiation (SR) are two highly influential factors affecting humans in space flight. Many health problems reported by astronauts derive from endothelial dysfunction and impaired homeostasis. Here we describe the adaptive response of human, capillary endothelial cells to space. Reference samples on ground and at 1g onboard allowed discrimination between the contribution of microgravity and SR within the combined response to space. Cell softening and reduced motility occurred in space, with loss of actin stress fibers and a greater distribution of microtubules and intermediate filaments in compensation. The frequency of primary cilia also increased. DNA repair mechanisms were indeed activated. Transcriptomics highlighted the opposing effect of microgravity from SR on specific molecular pathways: radiation, unlike microgravity, stimulated pathways for endothelial activation (hypoxia, inflammation), DNA repair and apoptosis, promoting an ageing-like phenotype; microgravity, unlike SR, activated pathways for metabolism and pro-proliferation phenotype. Thus, microgravity and SR should be considered separately to tailor effective countermeasures to protect astronautsâ health. To identify transcriptional changes induced by microgravity, space radiation, and their combination together with other stimuli in space flight, we used a model of human endothelial cells of microvascular origin (HMEC-1). Space samples were exposed to environmental microgravity (g) or set inside the centrifuge reproducing 1g; on ground samples were used as ground control.",

Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6â¯J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26â¯Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1â¯Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55â¯Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1â¯Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5â¯Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1â¯Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs Î³ rays (1â¯Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3â¯Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to Î³ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of Î± smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than Î³ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse.

      "description": "The increasing availability of flights on suborbital rockets creates new avenues for the study of spaceflight effects on biological systems, in particular the transitions between hypergravity and microgravity. This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3Îº:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3Îº:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight.",

      "description": "How to design experiments that accelerate knowledge discovery on complex biological landscapes remains a tantalizing question. Here, we present OPEX, an optimal experimental design method to identify informative omics experiments for both experimental space exploration and model training. OPEX-guided exploration ofâ¯ Escherichia coli's cross-behavior potential, when exposed to novel biocide and antibiotic combinations, led to accelerated knowledge discovery with predictive models that are more accurate while needing 44% fewer data to train. Selecting experiments favoring broader exploration followed by fine-tuning emerged as the optimal strategy. This led to the discovery of 29 cross-protection and 4 cross-vulnerability conditions, with further validation revealing the central role of chaperones, stress response proteins and transport pumps in cross-stress exposure. This work demonstrates how active learning can be used to automate omics data collection for training accurate predictive models, evidence-driven decision making and accelerated knowledge discovery in life sciences.",

      "description": "Due to limitations of available human models for development of gene expression based radiation biodosimetry, many such studies have made use of mouse models. To provide a broad view of the gene expression response to irradiation in the mouse, we have exposed male C57BL/6 mice to 0, 1.5, 3, 6 or 10âGy of gamma rays, sacrificing groups of the mice at 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days after exposure. We then profiled global gene expression in blood from individual mice using Agilent microarrays. In general, we found increasing numbers of genes differentially expressed with increasing dose, with more prolonged responses after the higher doses. Gene ontology analysis showed a similar pattern, with more biological processes enriched among the genes responding to higher doses, and at later times after exposure. Clustering the timecourse expression data using maSigPro identified four broad patterns of response, representing different gene ontology functions. The largest of these clusters included genes with initially decreased expression followed by increased expression at later times, a pattern of expression previously reported for several genes following neutron exposure. Another gene cluster showing consistent down regulation suggests genes useful for biodosimetry throughout the first week after exposure can be identified.",

While there are many intractable limitations for in-flight space research, some can be overcome by utilizing gene knockout-disease model mice. Here, we report how deletion of Nrf2, a master regulator of stress defense pathways, affects the health of mice transported for a stay in the International Space Station (ISS). After 31 days in the ISS, all flight mice returned safely to Earth. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed that the stresses of space travel evoked ageing-like changes of plasma metabolites and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Especially, Nrf2 was found to be important for maintaining homeostasis of white adipose tissues. This study opens approaches for future space research utilizing murine gene knockout-disease models, and provides insights into mitigating space-induced stresses that limit the further exploration of space by humans.",

To this end, ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT), and ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null) mice received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red), and were then delivered to the ISS aboard SpaceX-21. At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses were partially thawed and kidney tissues were removed and preserved by flash freezing in LN2. Kidneys were kept at -80 C freezer until processing. To ensure that both transcriptional profiling and protein expression profiling datasets are representative of the entire kidney, whole kidneys were first pulverized into a fine powder on dry ice. This powder was then split into two equal fractions with half being used for RNA isolation and half being used for protein isolation. RNA was used to generate three different transcriptional profiling datasets: a 3' tag-Seq datasets (20 M clusters at SE 93 bp), a polyA enriched dataset (60 M clusters at PE 150 bp), and a ribodepleted dataset (60 M clusters at PE 150 bp). Protein was used to generate protein expression profiling, and phosphoprotein profiling using the iTRAQ method (Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation).

A great deal of information has been available on the vegetative stage in space, but relatively little is known about the influence of spaceflight on plants at the reproductive stage. In this study, we constructed a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing flowering control gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), together with green fluorescent protein gene(GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which we induced FT expression inflight through remote controlling heating shock (HS) treatment. Inflight photography data showed that induction of FT expression in plants in space under short-day condition could eliminated the difference of stem length between spaceflight and ground control . Whole-genome microarray analysis of gene expression changes in leaves of wild-type and these transgenic plants grown under the long-day and short-day photoperiod conditions in space indicated that the function of the photoperiod-related spaceflight responsive genes are mainly involved in protein synthesis and post-translation protein modulation, notably protein phosphorylation. In addition, changes of circadian component gene expression in response to spaceflight under different photoperiod indicated that roles of circadian oscillator could act as integrators of spaceflight response and photoperiodic signals in Arabidopsis plants grown in space.",

      "description": "Intervertebral disc herniation rates are quadrupled in astronauts following spaceflight. While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (mCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts. This dataset was derived from the literature, and contains only grouped mCT data from the vertebra.",

      "description": "The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12 and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop, expressed genes indicative of ionic stresses, and many showed severe stress morphologies. Therefore, although in situ lunar regolith can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support.",

      "description": "Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (nâ equals 11â12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the Mechanical Testing, Bone Microstructure (microCT), and bone histomorphometry assays using femur tissue.",

      "title": "Altered rodent gait characteristics after ~35 days in orbit aboard the International Space Station",
      "description": "The long-term adaptations to microgravity and other spaceflight challenges within the confines of a spacecraft, and readaptations to weight-bearing upon reaching a destination, are unclear. While post-flight gait change in astronauts have been well documented and reflect multi-system deficits, no data from rodents have been collected. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate gait changes in response to spaceflight. A prospective collection of gait data was collected on 3 groups of mice: those who spent~35 days in orbit (FLIGHT) aboard the International Space Station (ISS); a ground-based control with the same habitat conditions as ISS (Ground Control; GC); and a vivarium control with typical rodent housing conditions (VIV). Pre-flight and post-flight gait measurements were conducted utilizing an optimized and portable gait analysis system (DigiGait, Mouse Specifics, Inc). The total data acquisition time for gait patterns of FLIGHT and control mice was 1.5â5 min/mouse, allowing all 20 mice per group to be assessed in less than an hour. Patterns of longitudinal gait changes were observed in the hind limbs and the forelimbs of the FLIGHT mice after ~35 days in orbit; few differences were observed in gait characteristics within the GC and VIV controls from the initial to the final gait assessment, and between groups. For FLIGHT mice, 12 out of 18 of the evaluated gait characteristics in the hind limbs were significantly changed, including: stride width variability; stride length and variance; stride, swing, and stance duration; paw angle and area at peak stance; and step angle, among others. Gait characteristics that decreased included stride frequency, and others. Moreover, numerous forelimb gait characteristics in the FLIGHT mice were changed at post-flight measures relative to pre-flight. This rapid DigiGait gait measurement tool and customized spaceflight protocol is useful for providing preliminary insight into how spaceflight could affect multiple systems in rodents in which deficits are reflected by altered gait characteristics. This dataset derives results from the behavior (gait) assay.",

      "description": "In the coming decade, astronauts will travel back to the moon in preparation for future Mars missions. Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is a major obstacle for deep space travel. Using multivariate principal components analysis, we found sex dimorphic responses in mice exposed to accelerated charged particles to simulate GCR (GCRsim); males displayed impaired spatial learning, whereas females did not. Mechanistically, these GCRsim induced learning impairments corresponded with chronic microglia activation and synaptic alterations in the hippocampus. Temporary microglia depletion shortly after GCRsim exposure mitigated GCRsim induced deficits measured months after the radiation exposure. Furthermore, blood monocyte levels measured early after GCRsim exposure were predictive of the late learning deficits and microglia activation measured in the male mice. Our findings (i) advance our understanding of charged particle induced cognitive challenges, (ii) provide evidence for early peripheral biomarkers for identifying late cognitive deficits, and (iii) offer potential therapeutic strategies for mitigating GCR induced cognitive loss. This study derives results from the behavior assays Elevated Plus Maze, Novel Object Recognition, Open Field, Radial Arm Water Maze, and Three Chamber Social Isolation/Interaction. These data are related to the Flow Cytometry data in OSD-776 (blood), OSD-777 (Microglia), and OSD-778 (Synapse).",

      "description": "There are unique stressors in the spaceflight environment. Exposure to such stressors is associated with adverse effects on astronauts' health, including increased cancer and cardiovascular disease risks. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, i.e., exosomes) play a vital role in intercellular communication and regulate various biological processes contributing to their role in disease pathogenesis. To assess whether spaceflight alters sEVs transcriptome profile, sEVs were isolated from the blood plasma of 3 astronauts at two different time points: 10 days before launch (L-10) and 3 days after return (R+3) from the Shuttle mission. Human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte cells (AC16) were treated with L-10 and R+3 astronauts-derived exosomes for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays. Enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr. Transcription factor enrichment analysis using the ENCODE/ChEA Consensus TF database identified gene sets related to the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and Vitamin D receptor (VDR) in AC16 cells treated with R+3 compared to cells treated with L-10 astronauts-derived exosomes. Further analysis of the histone modifications using datasets from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project confirmed enrichment in gene sets related to the H3K27me3 repressive mark. Interestingly, analysis of previously published H3K27me3âchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) ENCODE datasets showed enrichment of H3K27me3 in the VDR promoter. Collectively, our results suggest that astronaut-derived sEVs may epigenetically repress the expression of the VDR in human adult cardiomyocytes c by promoting the activation of the PRC2 complex and H3K27me3 levels. Gene expression was measured in untreated (n equals 3) and exosome-treated (n equals 6) AC16 human cardiomyocyte cell line. Cell were treated with exosomes isolated from 3 austonauts at two different time points: 10 days before mission (n equals 3) and 3 days upon return from mission (n equals 3).",

The 29th DLR parabolic flight campaign consisted of four consecutive flight days with thirty-one parabolas each day. Euglena gracilis cells were fixed with TRIzol during different acceleration conditions at the first and the last parabola of each flight. Samples were collected and analyzed with microarrays for one-color gene expression analysis. The data indicate significant changes in gene expression in E. gracilis within short time. Hierarchical clustering shows that changes induced by the different accelerations yield reproducible effects at independent flight days. Transcription differed between the first and last parabolas indicating adaptation effects in the course of the flight. Different gene groups were found to be affected in different phases of the parabolic flight, among others, genes involved in signal transduction, calcium signaling, transport mechanisms, metabolic pathways, and stress-response as well as membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. In addition, transcripts of other areas, e.g., DNA and protein modification, were altered. The study contributes to the understanding of short-term effects of microgravity and different accelerations on cells at a molecular level.",

      "description": "Bone growth may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven 23-week-old, adult female wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight female littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 murine calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), average cortical thickness (Ct.Th), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the spaceflight (SF) group compared to that of the ground control (GC) group, the mean BV Â± SD for the SF group was 1.904 Â± 0.842 mm3, compared to 1.758 Â± 0.122 mm3 for the GC group (p less than 0.05). Ct.Th demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 Â± 0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 Â± 0.005 mm in the SF group (p equals 0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 Â± 0.029 g/cm3 for the GC group and 0.893 Â± 0.028 g/cm3 for the SF group (p equals 0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes responsive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone adaptation independent of skeletal loading by tissue.

      "description": "It is well established that microgravity exposure causes significant muscle weakness and atrophy via muscle unloading. On Earth, muscle unloading leads to a disproportionate loss in muscle force and size with the loss in muscle force occurring at a faster rate. Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, a role for Ca2+ dysregulation has been suggested. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump actively brings cytosolic Ca2+ into the SR, eliciting muscle relaxation and maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). SERCA dysfunction contributes to elevations in [Ca2+]i, leading to cellular damage, and may contribute to the muscle weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight. Here, we investigated SERCA function, SERCA regulatory protein content, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) protein adduction in murine skeletal muscle after 35-37 days of spaceflight. In male and female soleus muscles, spaceflight led to drastic impairments in Ca2+ uptake despite significant increases in SERCA1a protein content. We attribute this impairment to an increase in RONS production and elevated total protein tyrosine (T) nitration and cysteine (S) nitrosylation. Contrarily, in the tibialis anterior (TA), we observed an enhancement in Ca2+ uptake, which we attribute to a shift towards a faster muscle fiber type (i.e., increased myosin heavy chain IIb and SERCA1a) without elevated total protein T-nitration and S-nitrosylation. Thus, spaceflight affects SERCA function differently between the soleus and TA. This dataset derives results from the calcium uptake (spectrofluorometry) and Western blot assays.",

Fischer 344 (F344) rats, which were 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age at the time of irradiation, were exposed to 56Fe particles (50 to 200 cGy). Concordant with previous results, the oldest rats spent less time exploring the open arms of the maze. Exposure to 56Fe particles also produced decreased exploration of the open arms of the plus maze. The dose needed to produce increased levels of anxiety was a function of age at the time of irradiation. The dose of 56Fe particles needed to produce a decrease in open arm exploration was significantly lower in the rats that were irradiated at 7 and 12 months of age than in the rats irradiated at 2 months of age. These results suggest the possibility that exposing middle aged astronauts to cosmic rays during exploratory class missions outside the magnetosphere, and the resultant effects on exploration induced anxiety, may affect their ability to successfully complete mission requirements. This dataset derives results from the Elevated Plus Maze assay. The data derived from this study are from the behavioral assays Novel Object Recognition and Operant Conditioning (bar press).

      "description": "On long-duration missions to other planets astronauts will be exposed to types and doses of radiation that are not experienced in low earth orbit. Previous research using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays has shown that exposure to heavy particles, such as 56Fe, disrupts spatial learning and memory measured using the Morris water maze. Maintaining rats on diets containing antioxidant phytochemicals for 2 weeks prior to irradiation ameliorated this deficit. The present experiments were designed to determine: (1) the generality of the particle-induced disruption of memory by examining the effects of exposure to 56Fe particles on object recognition memory; and (2) whether maintaining rats on these antioxidant diets for 2 weeks prior to irradiation would also ameliorate any potential deficit. The results showed that exposure to low doses of 56Fe particles does disrupt recognition memory and that maintaining rats on antioxidant diets containing blueberry and strawberry extract for only 2 weeks was effective in ameliorating the disruptive effects of irradiation. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms by which exposure to these particles may produce effects on neurocognitive performance.

      "description": "Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. Because of the potential threat of S. aureus to astronaut health, the effect of spaceflight conditions on this pathogen is of great interest. To gain insight into the virulence potential of S. aureus in the spaceflight environment, we performed differential expression (DE) analysis of RNA-Seq and cellular proteomics data from the âBiological Research in Canisters-23â (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit (LEO) on the international space station (ISS). This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground controls (GCs) and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 hours. Analysis of the RNA-Seq data revealed that RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene in spaceflight cultures (~88-fold) relative to GCs. Genes of the agr operon (~14 fold) were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding secreted phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) and secreted proteases, all of which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed a secretome analysis of culture supernatant samples from BRIC-23. In line with the other BRIC-23 omics data, spaceflight supernatants displayed significantly increased abundance of several known secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA, a small protein secreted by the type VII-like Ess secretion system. These data also suggested that S. aureus metabolism is altered in space flight conditions relative to the ground controls (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle and PTS systems, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery). Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.",

      "description": "NASA's planned mission to Mars will result in astronauts being exposed to ~ 350 mSv/yr of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR). A growing body of data from ground-based experiments indicates that exposure to space radiation doses (approximately those that astronauts will be exposed to on a mission to Mars) impairs a variety of cognitive processes, including cognitive flexibility tasks. Some studies report that 33% of individuals may experience severe cognitive impairment. Translating the results from ground-based rodent studies into tangible risk estimates for astronauts is an enormous challenge, but it would be germane for NASA to use the vast body of data from the rodent studies to start developing appropriate countermeasures, in the expectation that some level of space radiation (SR) -induced cognitive impairment could occur in astronauts. While some targeted studies have reported radiation-induced changes in the neurotransmission properties and/or increased neuroinflammation within space radiation exposed brains, there remains little information that can be used to start the development of a mechanism-based countermeasure strategy. In this study, we have employed a robust label-free mass spectrometry (MS) -based untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling approach to characterize the composition of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) proteome in rats that have been exposed to 15 cGy of 600 MeV/n 28Si ions. A variety of analytical techniques were used to mine the generated expression data, which in such studies is typically hampered by low and variable sample size. We have identified several proteins whose expression alters as a result of space radiation exposure, and a further subset of proteins differs in rats that have a high level of cognitive performance after SR exposure in comparison with those that have low performance levels. While this study has provided further insight into how SR impacts upon neurophysiology, and what adaptive responses can be invoked to prevent the emergence of SR-induced cognitive impairment, the main objective of this paper is to outline strategies that can be used by others to analyze sub-optimal data sets and to identify new information.",

      "description": "As we explore beyond Earth, astronauts may be at risk for harmful DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Double-strand breaks are a type of DNA damage that can be repaired by two major cellular pathways: non-homologous end joining, during which insertions or deletions may be added at the break site, and homologous recombination, in which the DNA sequence often remains unchanged. Previous work suggests that space conditions may impact the choice of DNA repair pathway, potentially compounding the risks of increased radiation exposure during space travel. However, our understanding of this problem has been limited by technical and safety concerns, which have prevented integral study of the DNA repair process in space. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system offers a model for the safe and targeted generation of double-strand breaks in eukaryotes. Here we describe a CRISPR-based assay for DNA break induction and assessment of double-strand break repair pathway choice entirely in space. As necessary steps in this process, we describe the first successful genetic transformation and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in space. These milestones represent a significant expansion of the molecular biology toolkit onboard the International Space Station.",

To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 10-12 week-old and twenty 32 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 40 days and allowed to recover for 2 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-1 included a total of 160 mice. This datasets features ribodepleted total RNA-seq data from mammary glands dissected from six LAR groups (young and old for flight, ground control, and vivarium control). Data from 5-10 livers per group are included. All samples include either Mix 1 or Mix 2 of the ERCC spike-in control. Target depth was 60 M clusters sequenced at PE 150 bp.",

We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to microgravity (SFÎ¼g) and artificially simulated Earth-gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFÎ¼g exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFÎ¼g and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFÎ¼g. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFÎ¼g brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFÎ¼g, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.",

      "description": "The microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) provides a unique stressor that can help understand underlying cellular and molecular drivers of pathological changes observed in astronauts with the ultimate goals of developing strategies to enable long- term spaceflight and better treatment of diseases on Earth. We used this unique environment to evaluate the effects of microgravity on kidney proximal tubule epithelial cell (PTEC) response to serum exposure and vitaminD biotransformation capacity. To test if microgravity alters the pathologic response of the proximal tubule to serum exposure, we treated PTECs cultured in a microphysiological system (PT-MPS) with human serum and measured biomarkers of toxicity and inflammation (KIM-1 and IL-6) and conducted global transcriptomics via RNAseq on cells undergoing flight (microgravity) and respective controls(ground). Given the profound bone loss observed in microgravity and PTECs produce the active form of vitamin D, we treated 3D cultured PTECs with 25(OH)D 3 (vitamin D) and monitored vitamin D metabolite formation, conducted global transcriptomics via RNAseq, and evaluated transcript expression of CYP27B1, CYP24A1, or CYP3A5 in PTECs undergoing flight (microgravity) and respective ground controls. We demonstrated that microgravity neither altered PTEC metabolism of vitamin D nor did it induce a unique response of PTECs to human serum, suggesting that these fundamental biochemical pathways in the kidney proximal tubule are not significantly altered by short-term exposure to microgravity. Given the prospect of extended spaceflight, more study is needed to determine if these responses are consistent with extended (greater than 6 months) exposure to microgravity.",

      "description": "TAC1 and LAZY1 are members of a gene family that regulates lateral shoot orientation in plants. TAC1 promotes outward orientations in response to light, while LAZY1 promotes upward shoot orientations in response to gravity via altered auxin transport. We performed genetic, molecular, and biochemical assays to investigate possible interactions between these genes. In Arabidopsis they were expressed in similar tissues and double mutants revealed the wide-angled lazy1 branch phenotype, indicating it is epistatic to the tac1 shoot phenotype. Surprisingly, the lack of TAC1 did not influence gravitropic shoot curvature responses. Combined, these results suggest TAC1 might negatively regulate LAZY1 to promote outward shoot orientations. However, additional results revealed that TAC1- and LAZY1 influence on shoot orientation is more complex than a simple direct negative regulatory pathway. Transcriptomes of Arabidopsis tac1 and lazy1 mutants compared to wild type under normal and gravistimulated conditions revealed few overlapping differentially expressed genes. Overexpression of each gene did not result in major branch angle differences. Shoot tip hormone levels were similar between tac1, lazy1, and Col, apart from exceptionally elevated levels of salicylic acid in lazy1. The data presented here provide a foundation for future study of TAC1 and LAZY1 regulation of shoot architecture.",

      "description": "Time-series RNAseq analysis following lateral root induction by gravistimulation. Lateral root organogenesis is a key process in the development of a plantâs root system and its adaptation to the environment. During lateral root formation, an early phase of cell proliferation first produces a four-cell-layered primordium, and only from this stage onwards is a root meristem-like structure, expressing root stem cell niche marker genes, being established in the developing organ. Previous studies reported that the gene regulatory network controlling lateral root formation is organized into two subnetworks whose mutual inhibition may contribute to organ patterning. PUCHI encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor expressed early during lateral root primordium development and required for correct lateral root formation. To dissect the molecular events occurring during this early phase, we generated time-series transcriptomic datasets profiling lateral root development in puchi-1 mutants and wild types. Transcriptomic and reporter analyses revealed that meristem-related genes were expressed ectopically at early stages of lateral root formation in puchi-1 mutants. We conclude that, consistent with the inhibition of genetic modules contributing to lateral root development, PUCHI represses ectopic establishment of meristematic cell identities at early stages of organ development. These findings shed light on gene network properties that orchestrate correct timing and patterning during lateral root formation.",

      "title": "Changes in DNA Methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana Plants Exposed Over Multiple Generations to Gamma Radiation",
      "description": "Previous studies have found indications that exposure to ionising radiation (IR) results in DNA methylation changes in plants. However, this phenomenon is yet to be studied across multiple generations. Furthermore, the exact role of these changes in the IR-induced plant response is still far from understood. Here, we study the effect of gamma radiation on DNA methylation and its effect across generations in young Arabidopsis plants. A multigenerational set-up was used in which three generations (Parent, generation 1, and generation 2) of 7-day old Arabidopsis thaliana plants were exposed to either of the different radiation treatments (30, 60, 110, or 430 mGy/h) or to natural background radiation (control condition) for 14 days. The parental generation consisted of previously non-exposed plants, whereas generation 1 and generation 2 plants had already received a similar irradiation in the previous one or two generations, respectively. Directly after exposure the entire methylomes were analysed with UPLC-MS/MS to measure whole genome methylation levels. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs), including their methylation context in the three generations and this for three different radiation conditions (control, 30 mGy/h, and 110 mGy/h). Both intra- and intergenerational comparisons of the genes and transposable elements associated with the DMRs were made. Taking the methylation context into account, the highest number of changes were found for cytosines followed directly by guanine (CG methylation), whereas only limited changes in CHG methylation occurred and no changes in CHH methylation were observed. A clear increase in IR-induced DMRs was seen over the three generations that were exposed to the lowest dose rate, where generation 2 had a markedly higher number of DMRs than the previous two generations (Parent and generation 1). Counterintuitively, we did not see significant differences in the plants exposed to the highest dose rate. A large number of DMRs associated with transposable elements were found, the majority of them being hypermethylated, likely leading to more genetic stability. Next to that, a significant number of DMRs were associated with genes (either in their promoter-associated region or gene body). A functional analysis of these genes showed an enrichment for genes related to development as well as various stress responses, including DNA repair, RNA splicing, and (a)biotic stress responses. These observations indicate a role of DNA methylation in the regulation of these genes in response to IR exposure and shows a possible role for epigenetics in plant adaptation to IR over multiple generations.",

      "description": "Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsisâ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (Âµg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters -Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.",

      "description": "Ionizing radiation is known to cause DNA damage, yet the mechanisms underlying potential transgenerational effects of exposure have been scarcely studied. Previously, we observed effects in offspring of zebrafish exposed to gamma radiation during gametogenesis. Here, we hypothesize that these effects are accompanied by changes of DNA methylation possibly inherited by subsequent generations. We assessed DNA methylation in F1 embryos (5.5 hours post fertilization) with whole genome bisulfite sequencing following parental exposure to 8.7 mGy/h for 27 days and found 5658 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). DMRs were predominantly located at known regulatory regions, such as gene promoters and enhancers. Pathway analysis indicated the involvement of DMRs related to similar pathways found with gene expression analysis, such as development, apoptosis and cancers, which could be linked to previous observed developmental defects and genomic instability in the offspring. Follow up of 19 F1 DMRs in F2 and F3 embryos revealed persistent effects up to the F3 generation at 5 regions. These results indicate that ionizing radiation related effects in offspring can be linked to DNA methylation changes that partly can persist over generations. Monitoring DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker to provide an indication of ancestral exposures to ionizing radiation.",

      "description": "M. marinum is a fish pathogen that usually only infects human skin, but it is genetically related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and has similar pathogenic mechanisms to these human pathogens. M. marinum and M. avium have been found in biofilms in water distribution systems and showerheads. Therefore, M. marinum is a biosafety level 2 model organism for biofilm-forming pathogenic mycobacteria. M. marinum prefer to form biofilms on hydrophobic surfaces and hydrophobic materials are used on the ISS, an example is silicone. In this study we wanted to examine the transcriptome changes of M. marinum exposed to simulated microgravity in biofilm-promoting medium. M. marinum expressing red fluorescent protein were grown in biofilm-promoting medium in flaskettes containing a piece of PDMS membrane attached to the slide. After filling the flaskettes, cultures were shipped to Kennedy Space station overnight. The flaskettes were attached to the RPM 2.0, or a lab-designed 3D clinostat which were positioned in the same incubator. For the normal gravity control, the flaskette was positioned on the shelf next to the microgravity simulators. After 4 days at 31 degrees C, the bacteria in suspension were used to prepare RNA and RNA-seq was performed to examine gene expression changes.",

      "description": "A detailed understanding of how the human body responds to spaceflight will be important to develop countermeasures for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies offer minimally invasive alternatives to traditional tissue biopsies, while also permitting the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids, which may resolve molecular heterogeneity and extend the multi-omics scope better than standard methods. Full-body molecular profiling using cell-free nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue for advancing space healthcare. Here, we perform a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days, and show that plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) can capture longitudinal gene expression responses of internal tissues to the spaceflight environment. Analysis of cfRNA collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirmed previously reported mitochondria dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identified an extracellular mitochondria (exMT)-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing analysis of the CD36 fraction revealed various tissue origins, some of which have not been well characterized due to their conventional inaccessibility. We compared our data to plasma cfRNA mouse data from a JAXA mission, in which on-board artificial gravity had been used, and discovered that microgravity induced the observed systemic responses. Our study used minimally invasive approaches to demonstrate exMT release as a conserved process in space and establishes the impact of gravity on Earth as an essential signal for normal homeostasis.",

      "description": "Differential organ growth during gravitropic response is caused by differential accumulation of auxin, that is, relative higher auxin concentration in lower flanks than in upper flanks of responding organs. Auxin responsive reporter systems such as DR5::GUS and DR5::GFP have usually been used as indicators of gravitropic response in roots and hypocotyls of Arabidopsis. However, in the inflorescence stems, the reporter systems don't work well to monitor gravitropic response. Here, we aim to certify appropriate gravitropic response indicators (GRIs) in inflorescence stems. We performed microarray analysis comparing gene expression profiles between upper and lower flanks of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems after gravistimulation. Thirty genes showed greater than 2-fold differentially increased expression in lower flanks at 30 min, of which 19 were auxin response genes. We focused on IAA5 and IAA2 and verified whether they are appropriate GRIs by real-time qRT-PCR analyses. Transcript levels of IAA5 and IAA2 were remarkably higher in lower flanks than in upper flanks after gravistimulation. The biased IAA5 or IAA2 expression is disappeared in sgr2-1 mutant which is defective in gravity perception, indicating that gravity perception process is essential for formation of the biased gene expression during gravitropism. IAA5 expression was remarkably increased in lower flanks at 30 min after gravistimulation, whereas IAA2 expression was gradually decreased in upper flanks in a time-dependent manner. Therefore, we conclude that IAA5 is a sensitive GRI to monitor asymmetric auxin signaling caused by gravistimulation in Arabidopsis inflorescence stems.",

      "description": "The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects is a chief concern. More recently, it has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression of neuroinflammation panel for inflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38+4 hours of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. Habitat ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware cages. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. The Neuroinflammation panel includes 757 genes covering the core pathways and processes that define neuroimmune interactions. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p less than 0.05) significantly segregates the GC group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated in FLT compared to the GC mice. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to antiviral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. These data indicate that neuroinflammation and altered immune reactions may be closely associate with spaceflight-induced stress response and have an impact on the neuronal function that may result in chronic neuroinflammation and late neurodegeneration. A total of 12 frozen right caudal half hemispheres containing mid- and hindbrain from GC and FLT mice (n equals 6 per group), were used for analysis",

      "description": "Electrophysiological alterations of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) with unloading are poorly studied. We aimed to investigate these aspects and the underlying molecular mechanisms with short-term unloading and active recovery (AR). Eleven healthy males underwent a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) period, followed by 21-day AR based on resistance exercise. Quadriceps femoris (QF) cross-sectional area (CSA) and isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) were evaluated. Intramuscular electromyographic recordings were obtained during 10% and 25% MVC isometric contractions from the vastus lateralis (VL). Biomarkers of NMJ molecular instability (serum c-terminal agrin fragment, CAF), axonal damage (neurofilament light chain) and denervation status were assessed from blood samples and VL biopsies. NMJ and ion channel transcriptomic profiles were investigated by RNA-sequencing. QF CSA and MVC decreased with ULLS. Increased CAF and altered NMJ transcriptome with unloading suggested the emergence of NMJ molecular instability, which was not associated with impaired NMJ transmission stability. Instead, increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates were found after ULLS. Downregulation of ion channel gene expression was found together with increased neurofilament light chain concentration and partial denervation. The AR period restored most of these neuromuscular alterations. In conclusion, the human NMJ is destabilized at the molecular level but shows functional resilience to a 10-day unloading period at least at relatively low contraction intensities. However, MUP properties are altered by ULLS, possibly due to alterations in ion channel dynamics and initial axonal damage and denervation. These changes are fully reversed by 21 days of AR. KEY POINTS: We used integrative electrophysiological and molecular approaches to comprehensively investigate changes in neuromuscular integrity and function after a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), followed by 21 days of active recovery in young healthy men, with a particular focus on neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) properties alterations. After 10-day ULLS, we found significant NMJ molecular alterations in the absence of NMJ transmission stability impairment. These findings suggest that the human NMJ is functionally resilient against insults and stresses induced by short-term disuse at least at relatively low contraction intensities, at which low-threshold, slow-type motor units are recruited. Intramuscular electromyography analysis revealed that unloading caused increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates, and these alterations could be related to the observed changes in skeletal muscle ion channel pool and initial and partial signs of fibre denervation and axonal damage. The active recovery period restored these neuromuscular changes.",

      "description": "The effects of short-term confinement on gene expression profiles in blood were evaluated. Fourteen days confinement study was conducted 2 times. In each experiment, 8 male subjects were stayed in an isolation and confinement facility at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. DNA microarray of extracted RNA from whole blood samples revealed that the expression levels of 3,659 genes were significantly altered by the 14-day confinement. The changes in gene expression profiles were not exactly the same as those in response to the other stress conditions, such as chronic psychological stress and spaceflight. In particular, 7 genes, LIN9, AK125040.1, MGC45922, C9orf173-AS1, OR1P1P, KRTAP10-12, and ARFRP1, responded to the confinement prominently. Therefore, the analysis of expression levels of these genes might be useful to assess the stress responses of human body to the confinement. In addition, biological interpretation of the alteration of gene expression profiles with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that 14-day confinement stimulated various signaling related to pro inflammation and leukocyte extravasation but suppressed apoptosis signaling. In agreement with the interpretation, the decrease of white blood cells in blood was confirmed during the confinement. On the other hand, red blood cells and platelets did not decrease. These results suggest that 14-day confinement is likely to induce shift of white blood cells from âthe circulating poolâ to âthe marginated poolâ.",

To gain insight into the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in response to radiation and microgravity, we analyzed RNA expression profiles in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells incubated for 24 h in static condition or in rotating condition to stimulate microgravity in space after 2 Gy Î³-ray irradiation. Expression of 14 lncRNAs and 17 mRNAs was found to be significantly down-regulated in the simulated microgravity condition. In contrast, irradiation up-regulated the expression of 55 lncRNAs and 56 mRNAs, while only one lncRNA, but no mRNA, was down-regulated. Furthermore, 2 miRNAs, 70 lncRNAs, and 87 mRNAs showed significantly altered expression under simulated microgravity after irradiation, and these changes were independently induced by irradiation and simulated microgravity. Together, our results indicate that simulated microgravity and irradiation additively and independently alter the expression of RNAs and their target genes in human lymphoblastoid cells.",

      "description": "Microgravity produces a variety of physical, chemical, and biological cues leading to an intricate and largely unresolved network of mechanosensitive molecules, transduction pathways, oxidative stress-related responses, and adaptations. The bone loss observed in astronauts and animal models after spaceflight is attributable to alterations in the bone tissue formation that depends on the continuous remodelling through the activities of bone-resorbing osteoclasts of hematopoietic lineage and bone-forming osteoblast of mesenchymal origin. Focusing on osteogenic differentiation, we present the results of the âSCD - Stem Cells Differentiationâ experiment, aiming to determine how human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) react to a prolonged (approx. 2 weeks) exposure to microgravity in terms of growth, and differentiation when treated with a physiological osteo-inducer as 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (Vit D3). The experiment was selected by the European Space Agency and transferred to ISS with the Soyuz-TMA- 16M (ISS 42S). It was carefully prepared because experiments performed on ISS remain a uniquely exceptional means of clarifying the microgravitational effects on osteogenesis, often only partially activated and detectable under simulated conditions. Because of the substantial reduction in calcification observed (about 50% inflight vs. on-ground control), we looked at significantly affected pathways in hBMSCs grown in microgravity vs. on-ground controls. Genome-wide expression changes were assessed via microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) and integrated with exosomal mi-RNA measurements. Multi-scale pathway analysis of the omics datasets revealed evidence of cell cycle arrest, occurring with a number of osteogenic gene markers, but without indications of adipogenesis, senescence and/or apoptosis.",

In this study a specially designed superconducting magnet with a large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF), which can provide three apparent gravity levels (Î¼-g, 1-g, and 2-g), was used to simulate a space-like gravity environment. Osteocyte, as the most important mechanosensor in bone, takes a pivotal position in mediating the mechano-induced bone remodeling. In this study, the effects of LG-HMF on gene expression profiling of osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 were investigated by Affymetrix DNA microarray. LG-HMF affected osteocyte gene expression profiling. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and data mining were further analyzed by using bioinfomatic tools, such as DAVID, iReport. 12 energy metabolism related genes (PFKL, AK4, ALDOC, COX7A1, STC1, ADM, CA9, CA12, P4HA1, APLN, GPR35 and GPR84) were further confirmed by real-time PCR. An integrated gene interaction network of 12 DEGs was constructed. Bio-data mining showed that genes involved in glucose metabolic process and apoptosis changed notablly. Our results demostrated that LG-HMF affected the expression of energy metabolism related genes in osteocyte. The identification of sensitive genes to special environments may provide some potential targets for preventing and treating bone loss or osteoporosis.",

      "description": "Microorganisms' natural ability to live as organized multicellular communities â also known as biofilms â provides them with unique survival advantages. For instance, biofilms are protected against environmental stresses thanks to their extracellular matrix, which could contribute to persistent infections after treatment. Biofilms are also capable of strongly attaching to surfaces, where their metabolism byproducts could lead to surface material degradation. Furthermore, microgravity can alter biofilm behavior in unexpected ways, making the presence of biofilms in space a risk for both astronauts and spaceflight hardware. Despite the efforts to eliminate microorganism contamination from spacecrafts surfaces, it is impossible to prevent human-associated bacteria or fungus from eventually establishing biofilm surface colonization. Nevertheless, by understanding the changes that biofilms undergo in microgravity, it is possible to identify key differences and pathways that could be targeted to significantly reduce biofilm formation. The Space Biofilms project, performed at the International Space Station, contributes to such understanding by characterizing the morphology and gene expression of bacterial and fungal biofilms formed in microgravity with respect to ground controls. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used as model organism for the bacterial morphology and transcriptomic studies, while Penicillium rubens was used for the fungal morphology study. Bacterial biofilm formation was characterized at one, two, and three days of incubation (37Â°C) over six different materials: stainless steel 316, passivated stainless steel 316, a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS), catheter grade silicone with and without a linear microtopography, and cellulose membrane.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/â4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment. This dataset is from the micro-computed tomography, immunostaining, and histology assays.",

Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.",

      "description": "Exposure to cosmic ionizing radiation is an innate risk of the spaceflight environment that can cause DNA damage and altered cellular function. In astronauts, longitudinal monitoring of physiological systems and interactions between these systems are important to consider for mitigation strategies. In addition, assessments of sex-specific biological responses in the unique environment of spaceflight are vital to support future exploration missions that include both females and males. Here we assessed sex-specific, multi-system immune and endocrine responses to simulated cosmic radiation. For this, 24-week-old, male and female C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to simplified five-ion, space-relevant galactic cosmic ray (GCRsim) radiation at 15 and 50 cGy, to simulate predicted radiation exposures that would be experienced during lunar and Martian missions, respectively. Blood and adrenal tissues were collected at 3- and 14-days post-exposure for analysis of immune and endocrine biosignatures and pathways. Sexually dimorphic adrenal gland weights and morphology, differential total RNA expression, and unique immune phenotypes were altered by GCRsim. In brief, this study offers new insights into sexually dimorphic immune and endocrine kinetics following simulated cosmic radiation exposure and highlights the necessity for personalized translational approaches for astronauts during exploration missions. This study includes data from adrenal samples only.",

      "description": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/â 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4â19.3 mmHg vs 16.3â20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.  This dataset derives results from Molecular Cellular Imaging (Microscopy) assay.",

The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight.

Total RNA was purified from each tube and mRNA was sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies direct RNA-sequencing kit on the PromethION. Data was used to generate differential gene expression profiles and annotate sites of m6A modification. Additionally, whole genome sequencing was performed on crew members at L-44 and R+45 and a clonal hematopoiesis panel was performed on a subset of 9 genes (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, CHEK2, JAK2, SRSF2, SF3B1, PPM1D).

One of these biospecimens was plasma from venous blood, which was collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and post-flight (R+1, R+45, R+82). Plasma was collected via three methods: cell-free DNA blood collection tubes (cfDNA BCTs), cell processing tubes (CPTs) and via Ficoll separation from K2 EDTA tubes. Plasma from cfDNA BCTs was used to isolate cfDNA for sequencing. Plasma from CPTs was used for proteomics. Plasma from the K2 EDTA tubes was used for metabolomics and to isolate extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) for mass spectrometry. Differential protein and metabolite abundances were calculated pre vs post-flight to generate processed data files.",

The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included deltoid skin biopsies, collected once pre-flight (L-44) and within 1 day postflight (R+1). Biopsies were 3mm - 4mm in diameter and were frozen at -80C at the time of collection. Samples were then embedded in OCT and prepared for spatially resolved transcriptomics using the NanoString GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel. Skin was profiled in four regions: outer epidermis (OE), inner epidermis (IE), outer dermis (OD), and vasculature (VA) regions. Four crew members were profiled pre-fight (C001, C002, C003, C004) and three crew members were profiled post-flight (C002, C003,  C004). Additionally, skin swabs of the deltoid region were collected before each biopsy. Skin swabs were first dipped in nuclease-free water before swabbing each region for 30 seconds. Swabs were stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield at 4C until nucleic acid extraction. DNA and RNA were extracted from the same swab to generate metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles.",

To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks-old mice were delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (January 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight, 20 Habitat Ground Control (HGC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post-flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Right tibialis anterior muscle samples were preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp).

To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (GC; 10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (BSL; 10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (VIV; 10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing ribodepleted gene expression data from hearts from 5 old and 5 young animals from each of the following groups: LAR basal, LAR ground control, LAR vivarium control, LAR flight, ISS-T basal, ISS-T ground control, and ISS-T flight.

      "title": "A molecular study of Italian ryegrass grown on Martian regolith simulant",
      "description": "In the last decade, the exploration of deep space has become the objective of the national space programs of many countries. The International Space Exploration Coordination Group has set a roadmap whose long-range strategy envisions the expansion of human presence in the solar system to progress with exploration and knowledge and to accelerate innovation. Crewed missions to Mars could be envisaged by 2040. In this scenario, finding ways to use the local resources for the provision of food, construction materials, propellants, pharmaceuticals is needed. Plants are important resources for deep space manned missions because they produce phytochemicals of pharmaceutical relevance, are sources of food and provide oxygen which is crucial in bioregenerative life support systems. Growth analysis and plant biomass yield have been previously evaluated on Martian regolith simulants; however, molecular approaches employing gene expression analysis and proteomics are still missing. The present work aims at filling this gap by providing molecular data on a representative member of the Poaceae, Lolium multiflorum Lam., grown on potting soil and a Martian regolith simulant (MMS-1). The molecular data were complemented with optical microscopy of root/leaf tissues and physico-chemical analyses. The results show that the plants grew for 2 weeks on regolith simulants. The leaves were bent downwards and chlorotic, the roots developed a lacunar aerenchyma and small brownish deposits containing Fe were observed. Gene expression analysis and proteomics revealed changes in transcripts related to the phenylpropanoid pathway, stress response, primary metabolism and proteins involved in translation and DNA methylation. Additionally, the growth of plants slightly but significantly modified the pH of the regolith simulants. The results here presented constitute a useful resource to get a comprehensive understanding of the major factors impacting the growth of plants on MMS-1.",

      "description": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/â 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and remeasured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4â19.3 mmHg vs 16.3â20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. This dataset derives results from the intraocular pressure (tonometry) assay.",

      "description": "Natural background radiation is a permanent multicomponent factor. It has an influence on biological organisms, but effects of its deprivation still remain unclear. The aim of our work was to study for the first time responses of D. melanogaster to conditions of the Deep Underground Low-Background Laboratory DULB-4900 (BNO, INR, RAS, Russia) at the transcriptome level by RNA-seq profiling. Overall 77 transcripts demonstrated differential abundance between flies exposed to low and natural background radiation. Enriched biological process functional categories were established for all genes with differential expression. The results showed down-regulation of primary metabolic processes and up-regulation of both the immune system process and the response to stimuli. The comparative analysis of our data and publicly available transcriptome data on D. melanogaster exposed to low and high doses of ionizing radiation did not reveal common DEGs in them. We hypothesize that the observed changes in gene expression can be explained by the influence of the underground conditions in DULB-4900, in particular, by the lack of stimuli. Thus, our study challenges the validity of the LNT model for the region of background radiation doses below a certain level (~16.4 nGy h-1) and the presence of a dose threshold for D. melanogaster.",

      "description": "Purpose: Astronauts traveling beyond low Earth orbit will be exposed to high linear energy transfer charged particles. Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs Î³ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to Î³ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of Î± smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than Î³ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse. This dataset derives result from the western blot, histology, and immunohistochemistry assays.",

      "description": "Human space exploration missions will continue the development of sustainable plant cultivation in what are obviously novel habitat settings. Effective pathology mitigation strategies are needed to cope with plant disease outbreaks in any space-based plant growth system. However, few technologies currently exist for space-based diagnosis of plant pathogens. Therefore, we developed a method of extracting plant nucleic acid that will facilitate the rapid diagnosis of plant diseases for future spaceflight applications. The microHomogenizer from Claremont BioSolutions, originally designed for bacterial and animal tissue samples, was evaluated for plantâmicrobial nucleic acid extractions. The microHomogenizer is an appealing device in that it provides automation and containment capabilities that would be required in spaceflight applications. Two different plant pathosystems were used to assess the versatility of the extraction process. Tomato and lettuce plants were respectively inoculated with a fungal plant pathogen, an oomycete pathogen, and a plant viral pathogen. The microHomogenizer, along with the developed protocols, proved to be an effective mechanism for producing DNA from two pathosystems, in that PCR and sequencing of the resulting samples demonstrated clear DNA-based diagnoses. Thus, this investigation advances the efforts to automate nucleic acid extraction for future plant disease diagnosis in space.",

Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.",

Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (nâ equals 11â12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the pQCT assay using tibia tissue.",

At 0.3 Gy, but not at 0.6 Gy  or 0.9 Gy, 28Si ion irradiation impaired cognition that correlated with  altered gene expression and 5hmC profiles that mapped to specific gene  ontology pathways. Comparing hippocampal DNA hydroxymethylation  following proton, 56Fe ion, and 28Si ion irradiation revealed a general  space radiation synaptic signature with 45 genes that are associated  with profound phenotypes.

      "description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-10 mission (RR-10) was to investigate how spaceflight affects the cellular and molecular mechanisms of normal bone tissue regeneration in space. To this end, ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT), and ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null) mice received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red), and were then delivered to the ISS aboard SpaceX-21. At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing data from left cerebral hemispheres from 4 WT flight animals and 5 WT ground control animals, and single nuclei transcriptomics and epigenomics data from left cerebral hemispheres from 5 WT flight animals, and 5 WT ground control animals.",

      "description": "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice.

Based on our previous space flight studies using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware on the STS-131 Space Shuttle mission, we found that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. This follow-up spaceflight experiment called the Advanced Plant EXperiments (APEX 03-1) in Space was designed to use Veggie unit on the ISS and on the ground unit on the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) to probe deeper into spaceflight-induced cell wall associated transcript expression changes. In this study we used RNA-Seq in combination with glycome profiling (glycomics) to correlate spaceflight-induced gene expression changes with actual cell wall modifications within seedlings.",

      "description": "Interplanetary space travel poses many hazards to the human body. To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6âmonthâold female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers. This dataset derives results from the behavior assays Balance Beam, Elevated Plus Maze, Open Field, Three Chamber Social Approach, Novel Object Recognition, and Radial Arm Water Maze using the same source animals as the flow cytometry blood samples in OSD-640.",

      "description": "The PESTO experiment was launched on April 8, 2002 onboard STS-110 (Atlantis) and was returned on June 19, 2002 onboard STS-111 (Endeavor), a total of 73 days in space. The ground control was conducted on a 14-day delay, and was harvested on July 3, 2002. During this period there were a total of 7 harvests of PESTO wheat and priming of 6 wheat root modules on orbit. A total of 18 plants were fixed on orbit for morphological and structural analysis, 4 plants were fixed for RNA and molecular genetic analysis and greater than 150 plants were frozen for biochemical analysis. A total of 3018 images of wheat chambers were collected from the BPS cameras during flight, and 3,640 images were obtained from the ground controls. A total of 65 digital images of the wheat harvest were collected during flight, with 75 being collected from ground controls. In addition, crew members recorded approximately 50 images and over 3 hrs of video of flight operations. Over 2 gigabytes of environmental data were obtained from the flight and ground control units. A ground control experiment was conducted in the BPS ground control chamber in the Orbiter Environment Simulator (OES) at the Kennedy Space Center Launch Site Support Facility in Hangar L. The ground control was delayed by 14-days from the real- time flight operations in order to duplicate the flight operations as closely as possible in a 1 g environment. At launch, two chambers were dedicated to the PESTO study, which consisted of three growth cycles using Apogee wheat. The third chamber was dedicated to the TVT study for the first growth cycle and used Apogee wheat. For the subsequent two wheat growth cycles, the third chamber was used for the PESTO study. For the first growth cycle in all Plant Growth Chambers, seeds were germinated pre-launch. In PESTO, the ages of the plants were staggered at launch so that comparisons of physiological and biochemical properties between mature plants, which were well developed and photosynthetically competent, and young plants could be studied. In-flight, plants were harvested at a specific age, and the initiation of the next cycle of growth was staggered between the chambers",

      "description": "The Virgin Galactic Unity 22 mission conducted the first astronaut-manipulated suborbital spaceflight experiment. The experiment examined the operationalization of Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) as a generalizable approach to preserving biology at various phases of suborbital flight. The biology chosen for this experiment was Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Col-0, because of the plantâs history of spaceflight experimentation within KFTs and wealth of comparative data from orbital experiments. KFTs were deployed as a wearable device, a leg pouch attached to the astronaut, which proved to be operationally effective during the course of the flight. Data from the inflight samples indicated that the microgravity period of the flight elicited the strongest transcriptomic responses as measured by the number of genes showing differential expression. Genes related to reactive oxygen species and stress, as well as genes associated with orbital spaceflight, were highly represented among the suborbital gene expression profile. In addition, gene families largely unaffected in orbital spaceflight were diversely regulated in suborbital flight, including stress-responsive transcription factors. The human-tended suborbital experiment demonstrated the operational effectiveness of the KFTs in suborbital flight and suggests that rapid transcriptomic responses are a part of the temporal dynamics at the beginning of physiological adaptation to spaceflight.",

      "description": "The cardiovascular system is strongly impacted by the hazards of spaceflight. Astronauts spending steadily increasing lengths of time in microgravity are subject to cardiovascular deconditioning resulting in loss of vascular tone, reduced total blood volume, and diminished cardiac output. Appreciating the mechanisms by which the cells of the vasculature are altered during spaceflight will be integral to understanding and combating these deleterious effects as the human presence in space advances. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis coupled with review by QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software on human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) cultured for 3 days in microgravity and aboard the International Space Station to assess the transcriptomic changes that occur during spaceflight. The results of our RNA-Seq analysis show that SMCs undergo a wide range of transcriptional alteration while in space, significantly affecting 4,422 genes. SMCs largely down-regulate markers of the contractile, synthetic, and osteogenic phenotypes including smooth muscle alpha actin (Î±SMA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Additionally, components of several cellular signaling pathways were strongly impacted including the STAT3, NFÎºB, PI3K/AKT, HIF1Î±, and Endothelin pathways. This study highlights the significant changes in transcriptional behavior SMCs exhibit during spaceflight and puts these changes in context to better understand vascular function in space.",

      "description": "Interplanetary space travel poses many hazards to the human body. To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6âmonthâold female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers. This dataset derives results from the flow cytometry assay using blood samples from same source animals used for behavioral studies in OSD-618.",

      "description": "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research missions RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA and micro computed tomography assays using tibia tissue from the RR9 mission and hindlimb unloaded/suspended (HLU/HLS) animals. The tibia data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-660 (Tibialis Anterior), OSD-661 (Lumbar Spine), OSD-662 (Soleus), OSD-663 (Femur), and OSD-664 (Extensor Digitorum Longus).",

The simulated GCR irradiation was carried out in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). The exposures were conducted acutely for two dose points at 40 cGy or 80 cGy, with sequential delivery of proton, helium, oxygen, silicon, and iron ions. Control and irradiated seedlings were then harvested and stabilized in RNAlater at 3 hrs. post irradiation. Total RNA was isolated for transcriptomic analyses using RNAseq. The data revealed that the transcriptomic responses were dose-dependent, with significant upregulation of DNA repair pathways and downregulation of glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways. Glucosinolates are important for plant pathogen defense and for the taste of a plant, which are both relevant to growing plants for spaceflight. These findings fill in knowledge gaps of how plants respond to radiation in beyond-Earth environments.",

      "description": "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA Scanning assay using lumbar spine tissue from HLS mice. The lumbar spine data in this study are related to other studies using tissues from the same experiment; OSD-654 (tibia), OSD-660 (tibialis anterior), OSD-662 (soleus), OSD-663 (femur), and OSD-664 (extensor digitorum longus).",

      "description": "Human expansion into the solar system is currently at the forefront of space research. For our astronauts to survive, they will need to be fed a healthy and nutritious diet on a consistent basis. Right now, our current method of feeding astronauts consists of resupplied prepackaged food from Earth, which is unsustainable for long-term missions. Using planetary resources via in situ resource utilization to grow crops is the next step toward sustainability in space. Asteroids are an abundant space resource and should not be overlooked when considering crewed missions. In particular, the primordial CI carbonaceous asteroids are of interest because the regolith is suggested to contain soluble elemental nutrients, such as phosphorous and potassium, that crops can use for growth and development. We present a study on the ability of CI carbonaceous asteroid regolith simulant to sustain plant growth of lettuce (Latuca sativa), radishes (Raphanus sativus), and peppers (Capsicum annuum). We tested growing the selected crops in increasing mixtures of simulant and peat moss. The results showed that each species reacted differently to each treatment and that the radishes were more affected by the treatments. Subsequent analysis showed that the simulant contains small amounts of plant-usable nutrients, despite its high pH, low cation exchange capacity, and classification as a silt-based soil. Our results indicate that the simulant is prone to compaction and crusting, leading to drought stress on the crops. Further investigations are needed to determine mitigation strategies to make CI asteroid regolith a more conducive soil. This data set derives results from the Image Analysis Photography assay with leaf area measurements. Additional data provided in the sample table includes plant height and biomass measurements as well as a thorough analysis of the substrate including pH, elemental analysis, and soil texture analysis.",

      "description": "The Characterizing Arabidopsis Root Attractions (CARA) spaceflight experiment provides comparative transcriptome analyses of plants grown in both light and dark conditions within the same spaceflight. CARA compared three genotypes of Arabidopsis grown in ambient light and in the dark on board the International Space Station (ISS); Col-0, Ws, and phyD, a phytochrome D mutant in the Col-0 background. In all genotypes, leaves responded to spaceflight with a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than root tips, and each genotype displayed distinct light / dark transcriptomic patterns that were unique to the spaceflight environment. The Col-0 leaves exhibited a substantial dichotomy, with ten-times as many spaceflight DEGs exhibited in light-grown plants versus dark-grown plants. Although the total number of DEGs in phyD leaves is not very different from Col-0, phyD altered the manner in which light-grown leaves respond to spaceflight, and many genes associated with the physiological adaptation of Col-0 to spaceflight were not represented. This result is in contrast to root tips, where a previous CARA study showed that phyD substantially reduced the number of DEGs. There were few DEGs, but a series of space-altered gene categories, common to genotypes and lighting conditions. This commonality indicates that key spaceflight genes are associated with signal transduction for light, defense, and oxidative stress responses. However, these key signaling pathways enriched from DEGs showed opposite regulatory direction in response to spaceflight under light and dark conditions, suggesting a complex interaction between light as a signal, and light-signaling genes in acclimation to spaceflight.",

      "description": "This ground-based program was intended to address the etiology of visual system structural and functional changes observed in astronauts during both inflight and postflight periods. Using the well-documented rat hindlimb suspension (HLS) model, functionally equivalent to human head-down bedrest, we examined the relationship between cephalic fluid shifts resulting from long-duration G-unloading and the regulation of intracranial and intraocular pressures, as well as the effects these same cephalic fluid shifts have on visual system structure and function. Animals were chronically instrumented with biotelemetry to continuously measure intracranial pressure. Additionally, regular intraocular pressure measurements were made by tonometry during long-term exposure to cephalic fluid shifts induced by suspension. MRI images visualizing the visual system morphology were collected from HLS and control animals at regular intervals. Retinal morphology and ultrastructure were examined at specified intervals both during HLS and post-HLS recovery by ophthalmic examinations. This program utilized both male and female subjects in order to examine possible sex differences in these responses. We also examined the possible contributory factors of aging and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) on these responses of the visual system. Further, in addition to mimicking the effects of long duration exposure to microgravity through the use of the HLS model, we examined the responses of our measured outcomes during long-term recovery in the post-HLS period. Collectively, these data will help  us to develop a model to both understand and predict the etiology of changes in visual structure and function in astronauts exposed to the microgravity of spaceflight and during postflight recovery. This study investigated the development of a translational mammalian model within the context of hindlimb unloading, sex, and aging by which the data generated using this model can facilitate the development of countermeasures to alleviate any visual system decrements arising from exposure to the microgravity spaceflight environment.

      "description": "Staphylococcus aureus is commonly isolated from astronauts returning from spaceflight missions. Previous analysis of BRIC-23 omics data generated from S. aureus low Earth orbit cultures indicated significantly increased expression of the Agr quorum sensing system and its downstream targets in spaceflight samples compared to ground controls. In this current study, the rotary cell culture system (RCCS) was used to investigate the effect of low shear modelled microgravity (LSMMG) on S. aureus physiology and Agr activity. When cultured in BRIC-23 medium and temperature conditions, S. aureus LSMMG cultures exhibited decreased agr expression and altered growth compared to normal gravity control cultures, which are typically oriented with gas permeable membrane on bottom of the high aspect rotating vessel (HARV). However, when grown in an inverted gravity control orientation (membrane on top of the HARV), reduced Agr activity was observed relative to both traditional control and LSMMG cultures, signifying that oxygen availability may affect the observed differences in agr expression. Metabolite assays revealed increased lactate and decreased acetate excretion in both LSMMG and inverted control cultures. Secretomics analysis of LSMMG, control, and inverted control HARV culture supernatants corroborated these results, with inverted and LSMMG cultures exhibiting decreased abundance of Agr-regulated virulence factors and increased abundance of low-oxygen metabolic proteins. Collectively, these studies suggest that orientation of the HARV gas permeable membrane can affect S. aureus physiology and Agr quorum sensing in the RCCS, a variable that should be considered when interpreting data using this ground-based microgravity model.",

      "description": "Microphysiological systems provide the opportunity to model accelerated changes at the human tissue level in the extreme space environment. Spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy experienced by astronauts shares similar physiological changes to muscle wasting in older adults, known as sarcopenia. These shared attributes provide a rationale for investigating molecular changes in muscle cells exposed to spaceflight that may mimic the underlying pathophysiology of sarcopenia. We report the results from three-dimensional myobundles derived from muscle biopsies from young and older adults, integrated into an autonomous CubeLabâ¢, and flown to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard SpaceX CRS-21 as part of the NIH/NASA funded Tissue Chips in Space program. Global transcriptomic RNA-Seq analyses comparing the myobundles in space and on the ground revealed downregulation of shared transcripts related to myoblast proliferation and muscle differentiation. The analyses also revealed downregulated differentially expressed gene pathways related to muscle metabolism unique to myobundles derived from the older cohort exposed to the space environment compared to ground controls. Gene classes related to inflammatory pathways were downregulated in flight samples cultured from the younger cohort compared to ground controls. Our muscle tissue chip platform provides an approach to studying the cell autonomous effects of spaceflight on muscle cell biology that may not be appreciated on the whole organ or organism level and sets the stage for continued data collection from muscle tissue chip experimentation in microgravity. We also report on the challenges and opportunities for conducting autonomous tissue-on-chip CubeLabâ¢ payloads on the ISS.",

We examined the roles of anti-oxidative sulfur-containing compounds on hepatic damage after spaceflight. We analyzed the livers of mice on board the International Space Station for 30Â days. During spaceflight, half of the mice were exposed to artificial earth gravity (1Â g) using centrifugation cages. Sulfur-metabolomics of the livers of mice after spaceflight revealed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants (ergothioneine, glutathione, cysteine, taurine, thiamine, etc.) and their intermediates (cysteine sulfonic acid, hercynine, N-acethylserine, serine, etc.) compared to the controls on the ground. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing showed upregulation of gene sets related to oxidative stress and sulfur metabolism, and downregulation of gene sets related to glutathione reducibility in the livers of mice after spaceflight, compared to controls on the ground. These changes were partially mitigated by exposure to 1Â g centrifugation. For the first time, we observed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants based on a comprehensive analysis of the livers of mice after spaceflight. Our data suggest that a decrease in sulfur-containing compounds owing to both microgravity and other spaceflight environments (radiation and stressors) contributes to liver damage after spaceflight.",

Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)Â exposed to short term (25âhours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.",

      "description": "Spaceflight-related stresses impact health via various body systems, including the haematopoietic and immune systems, with effects ranging from moderate alterations of homoeostasis to serious illness. Oxidative stress appears to be involved in these changes, and the transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates expression of a set of cytoprotective and antioxidative stress response genes, has been implicated in the response to spaceflight-induced stresses. Here, we show through analyses of mice from the MHU-3 project, in which Nrf2-knockout mice travelled in space for 31 days, that mice lacking Nrf2 suffer more seriously from spaceflight-induced immunosuppression than wild-type mice. We discovered that a one-month spaceflight-triggered the expression of tissue inflammatory marker genes in wild-type mice, an effect that was even more pronounced in the absence of Nrf2. Concomitant with induction of inflammatory conditions, the consumption of coagulation-fibrinolytic factors and platelets was elevated by spaceflight and further accelerated by Nrf2 deficiency. These results highlight that Nrf2 mitigates spaceflight-induced inflammation, subsequent immunosuppression, and thrombotic microangiopathy. These observations reveal a new strategy to relieve health problems encountered during spaceflight.",

      "description": "Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of spaceflown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCAâs ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with antioxidant treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak. This study derives results from the Western Blot and ATPase Assays using soleus tissue from the RR-18 mission.",

      "description": "On Earth, people spend 90% of their time indoors where dust and moisture can facilitate rapid microbial growth, especially fungi. The International Space Station is a specialized closed environment that contains own unique indoor microbiome. Elevated moisture such as from a temporary ventilation system malfunction may lead to unintended microbial growth indoors, which is associated with negative health outcomes and degradation of essential built environment materials. We need to develop a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth to understand when it may occur in these critical indoor spaces. Here we demonstrate that exposure to even fluctuating elevated relative humidity above 80% can lead to rapid microbial growth and community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We were able to model fungal growth in space station dust using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions, respectively. Alpha and beta diversity of fungi was altered with both significantly decreasing as relative humidity and time elevated increased. Our results demonstrate that we can use moisture conditions to develop predictive models for fungal growth and composition. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can protect astronaut health, spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.",

While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.

      "description": "The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. This study contains data of cerebral cortex region. The data of other brain regions are deposited in OSD-682 (cornu ammonis 1), OSD-685 (dentate gyrus), and OSD-698 (frontal cortex).",

      "description": "Microbes are present in all occupied indoor environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). An unexpected ventilation system failure may lead to microbial and fungal growth that is associated with material degradation or negative health effects. There is a need for improved understanding of fungal function when exposed to moisture in indoor spaces. A de novo metatranscriptomic study was performed using dust collected from within the ISS. After returning to Earth, dust was incubated in laboratory chambers to simulate relative humidity conditions of 50%, 85%, or 100% equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) for 1-week. Changes in fungal function (gene expression) were associated with moisture exposure. Genes associated with secondary metabolism and fungal growth were significantly upregulated (p â¤ 0.001, log2FC â¥ 2) at elevated RH conditions (85% or 100% ERH). Elevated moisture conditions showed an increased expression of mycotoxin and fungal allergen genes such as Asp f 4 and Alt a 7 (log2FC â¥ 5). These results demonstrate that understanding microbial gene expression in response to elevated moisture will help improve microbial monitoring standards for confined spacecraft environments and help protect astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.",

While the adaptations of tendon to internal stimuli have been extensively researched, the impact of environmental factors (such as microgravity) on its structure and function at the nanoscopic scale (i.e., fibril level) remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 32 days (d) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on murine tendon collagen fibril morphology and nanomechanics (Youngâs Modulus, YM). Quadriceps tendon samples from 16wk old female C57BL/6J mice aboard NASA Rodent Research-1 underwent chemical processing and mechanical isolation. Subsequently, collagen fibrils (n equals 38) were studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM, JPK NanoWizard 4a) to compare the morphology (diameter, height) and nanomechanics (average YM) between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) mouse tendon samples. The qp-BioAC-CB1 cantilever (spring constant: 0.3 N/m, tip radius: 10Âµm) was used under quantitative imaging mode (Qi) for all force and morphological measurements. The data from 17 micrographs (SF n equals 23; GC n equals 15) was processed via the JPK Data Processing Software (Version 6.4.5.), and finally analyzed via Gwyddion (Version 2.62). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to use AFM QI-mode on tendon collagen fibrils after spaceflight. Mean fibril size and YM were similar between SF and GC mouse tendon fibrils after 32 days of space flight; these results suggest that collagen fibrils may require more time to adapt to changes in their environment, and/or more rapid changes may take place at different levels of the collagen hierarchy. This data provides valuable insights into mammalian tissue adaptations during spaceflight, and future research should continue these investigations with longer-duration missions to build a time-course of tendon adaptations to microgravity.

      "description": "Skeletal muscle is sensitive to gravitational alterations. We recently developed a multiple artificial-gravity research system (MARS), which can generate gravity ranging from microgravity to Earth gravity (1âg) in space. Using the MARS, we studied the effects of three different gravitational levels (microgravity, lunar gravity [1/6âg], and 1âg) on the skeletal muscle mass and myofiber constitution in mice. All mice survived and returned to Earth, and skeletal muscle was collected two days after landing. We observed that microgravity-induced soleus muscle atrophy was prevented by lunar gravity. However, lunar gravity failed to prevent the slow-to-fast myofiber transition in the soleus muscle in space. These results suggest that lunar gravity is enough to maintain proteostasis, but a greater gravitational force is required to prevent the myofiber type transition. Our study proposes that different gravitational thresholds may be required for skeletal muscle adaptation.",

      "description": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1âg on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38â+/-â4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4-19.3âmmHg vs 16.3-20.3âmmHg) (pâ less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (pâ less than â0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.",

In astronauts, longitudinal monitoring of physiological systems and interactions between these systems are important to consider for mitigation strategies. In addition, assessments of sex-specific biological responses in the unique environment of spaceflight are vital to support future exploration missions that include both females and males. Here we assessed sex-specific, multi-system immune and endocrine responses to simulated cosmic radiation. For this, 24-week-old, male and female C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to simplified five-ion, space-relevant galactic cosmic ray (GCRsim) radiation at 15 and 50 cGy, to simulate predicted radiation exposures that would be experienced during lunar and Martian missions, respectively. Blood and adrenal tissues were collected at 3- and 14-days post-exposure for analysis of immune and endocrine biosignatures and pathways. Sexually dimorphic adrenal gland weights and morphology, differential total RNA expression, and unique immune phenotypes were altered by GCRsim. In brief, this study offers new insights into sexually dimorphic immune and endocrine kinetics following simulated cosmic radiation exposure and highlights the necessity for personalized translational approaches for astronauts during exploration missions. This study includes data from blood samples only.",

We reported heart failure with preserved ejection fraction like cardiac phenotype 660-days following exposure to a single-dose of a simplified galactic cosmic ray simulation (simGCRsim) only in males with functional and structural impairment in left ventricular (LV) function. This sex-based dichotomy prompted us to investigate sex-specific changes in the LV transcriptome in three-month-old male and female mice exposed to 137Cs-gamma- or simGCRsim-IR. Non-IR male and female (10 each) mice served as controls. LVs were collected at 440/660- and 440/550-days post-IR, male and female, respectively. RNA sequencing, differential gene expression, and functional annotation were performed on tissues from 5 mice/group. Sex and post-IR time points had the greatest influence on gene expression, surpassing the IR-type effects. SimGCRsim-IR showed more persistent transcriptome changes than gamma-IR. We suggest that the single IR effects can persist up to 550â660 days, with overwhelmingly sex-biased responses at individual gene expression level.",

One such environment that can significantly affect innate immunity is spaceflight. In this study, we explored the impact of microgravity stress on key elements of the NFÎºB innate immune pathway. The symbiosis between the bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes and its beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri was used as a model system under a simulated microgravity environment. The expression of genes associated with the NFÎºB pathway was monitored over time as the symbiosis progressed. Results revealed that although the onset of the symbiosis was the major driver in the differential expression of NFÎºB signaling, the stress of simulated low-shear microgravity also caused a dysregulation of expression. Several genes were expressed at earlier time points suggesting that elements of the E. scolopes NFÎºB pathway are stress-inducible, whereas expression of other pathway components was delayed. The results provide new insights into the role of NFÎºB signaling in the squid-vibrio symbiosis, and how the stress of microgravity negatively impacts the host immune response. Together, these results provide a foundation to develop mitigation strategies to maintain host-microbe homeostasis during spaceflight.",

      "description": "Ionic silver (Ag+) is being investigated as a residual biocide for use in NASA spacecraft potable water systems on future crewed missions. This water will be used to irrigate future spaceflight crop production systems. We have evaluated the impact of three concentrations (31 ppb, 125 ppb, and 500 ppb) of ionic silver biocide solutions on lettuce in an arcillite (calcinated clay particle substrate) and hydroponic (substrate-less) growth setup after 28 days. Lettuce plant growth was reduced in the hydroponic samples treated with 31 ppb silver and severely stunted for samples treated at 125 ppb and 500 ppb silver. No growth defects were observed in arcillite-grown lettuce. Silver was detectable in the hydroponic-grown lettuce leaves at each concentration but was not detected in the arcillite-grown lettuce leaves. Specifically, when 125 ppb silver water was applied to a hydroponics tray, Ag+ was detected at an average amount of 7 ug/g (dry weight) in lettuce leaves. The increase in Ag+ corresponded with a decrease in several essential elements in the lettuce tissue (Ca, K, P, S). In the arcillite growth setup, silver did not impact the plant root zone microbiome in terms of alpha diversity and relative abundance between treatments and control. However, with increasing silver concentration, the alpha diversity increased in lettuce root samples and in the water from the hydroponics tray samples. The genera in the hydroponic root and water samples were similar across the silver concentrations but displayed different relative abundances. This suggests that ionic silver was acting as a selective pressure for the microbes that colonize the hydroponic water. The surviving microbes likely utilized exudates from the stunted plant roots as a carbon source. Analysis of the root-associated microbiomes in response to silver showed enrichment of metagenomic pathways associated with alternate carbon source utilization, fatty-acid synthesis, and the ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) stringent response global regulatory system that operates under conditions of environmental stress. Nutrient solutions containing Ag+ in concentrations greater than 31 ppb in hydroponic systems lacking cation-exchange capacity can severely impact crop production due to stunting of plant growth.",

Here the effects of simulated microgravity (SÂµG) on gene expression and genome evolution of E. coli REL606, a strain evolved terrestrially for 35Â years, is explored. The transcriptomic changes for glucose-limited and glucose-replete conditions over 24Â h illustrate that SÂµG increased the expression of genes involved in stress response, biofilm, and metabolism. A greater number of differentially expressed genes related to the general stress response (GSR) and biofilm formation is observed in simulated microgravity cultures under glucose-limited conditions in comparison to glucose-replete conditions. Longer term SÂµG culture under glucose-limited conditions led to the accumulation of unique mutations when compared to control cultures, particularly in the mraZ/fruR intergenic region and the elyC gene, suggesting changes in peptidoglycan and enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) production. These findings highlight the physiological and genomic adaptations of E. coli to microgravity, offering a foundation for future research into the long-term effects of space conditions on bacterial evolution.",

In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days.

Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.

The purpose was to study the efficacy of microgravity to model impaired muscle regeneration in an engineered muscle platform and then to demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug screening in this model. Engineered human muscle was launched to the International Space Station National Laboratory, where the effect of microgravity exposure for 7Â days was examined by transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. Gene set enrichment analysis of engineered muscle cultured in microgravity, compared to normal gravity conditions, highlighted a metabolic shift toward lipid and fatty acid metabolism, along with increased apoptotic gene expression. The addition of pro-regenerative drugs, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase inhibitor (15-PGDH-i), partially inhibited the effects of microgravity. In summary, microgravity mimics aspects of impaired myogenesis, and the addition of these drugs could partially inhibit the effects induced by microgravity.

      "description": "There is increasing interest in the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) on plants as might occur during spaceflight, or as a consequence of human activities, such as nuclear power generation, that may result in the release of radioactive materials into the environment. High doses of IR have long been used for the induction of mutations in plants with the goal of generating desirable traits for agribusiness. However, less is known about the responses of plants to acute low doses of IR exposure. Here, we take a multi-omics approach to characterize the response to low dose IR in A. thaliana. We adapt the Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates (MAPit) technique for use in plants allowing us to assay the epigenetic response to acute low-dose IR (10 cGy and 100 cGy) 72 hr after exposure, and, in parallel, use RNA sequencing to profile the transcription response at 1, 3, 24 and 72 hr after exposure. We observe that IR exposures as low as 10 cGy elicit robust genetic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana detectable as early as 1 hr after exposure. Examination of these responses revealed dose-dependent changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation that implicate the ethylene signalling pathway and response to abiotic stress as underlying the transcriptional and epigenetic changes associated with IR. These changes are observable up to 72 hr after exposure suggesting that they are maintained well after the initial acute exposure. Our findings indicate that A. thaliana executes a coordinated, multi-modal response to low-dose IR through induction and regulation of the ethylene response pathway.",

      "description": "Microgravity has been shown to lead to both muscle atrophy and impaired muscle regeneration. The purpose was to study the efficacy of microgravity to model impaired muscle regeneration in an engineered muscle platform and then to demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug screening in this model. Engineered human muscle was launched to the International Space Station National Laboratory, where the effect of microgravity exposure for 7Â days was examined by transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. Gene set enrichment analysis of engineered muscle cultured in microgravity, compared to normal gravity conditions, highlighted a metabolic shift toward lipid and fatty acid metabolism, along with increased apoptotic gene expression. The addition of pro-regenerative drugs, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase inhibitor (15-PGDH-i), partially inhibited the effects of microgravity. In summary, microgravity mimics aspects of impaired myogenesis, and the addition of these drugs could partially inhibit the effects induced by microgravity.

      "description": "Purpose: Space exploration poses unique challenges to astronauts, especially the effects of space radiation and microgravity (uG). Understanding molecular responses to these factors is crucial for ensuring astronaut health, and this study aimed to identify transcriptomic changes in mouse hypothalamic cell line N38 (mHypoE-N38) caused by simulated space environments. Method: Four experimental groups were established, namely, a ground condition group (GC; the control group), a proton irradiated group (the space radiation group), a simulated uG group, and a proton irradiatedÂ ÃÂ simulated uG group (the combination group). RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to investigate key altered genes and to validate them. Results: Three hundred and fifty-five differentially expressed genes were identified. Notably, the expressions of UCN2 and UGT1A5 genes were upregulated in all three experimental groups, suggesting a shared regulatory mechanism with potential consequences for brain function during space missions. Moreover, the study revealed significant alterations in genes belonging to the USP17 and ZSCAN4 families, indicating active response to DNA damage and telomere maintenance. PCR results validated that UGT1A5, USP17 family, and ZSCAN4 families (ZSCAN4C, ZSCAN4D, and ZSCAN4F) were significantly upregulated at the mRNA level in the combination group, while UCN2, ZSCAN4A, and ZSCAN4B were not reproduced. Conclusion: The present study on mHypoE-N38Â cells exposed to space environments revealed a complex molecular narrative with disease-oriented implications. The knowledge gained might serve as a cornerstone for developing strategies to mitigate potential health risks associated with extended exposure to space-related stressors.",

      "description": "Genomic plasticity helps adapt to extreme environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to space environment (ESE) impacts the epigenome inducing genomic plasticity. Murine skin samples from the Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 were procured from the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory. Targeted RNA sequencing to test differential gene expression between the skin of ESE versus ground controls revealed upregulation of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis pathways secondary to promoter hypomethylation in responders. Methylome sequencing identified ESE-sensitive hypomethylated genes including developmental angiogenic genes Araf, Vegfb, and Vegfr1. Based on differentially expressed genes, the angiogenesis biofunction was enriched in responders. The induction of genomic plasticity in response to ESE, as reported herein, may be viewed as a mark of biological resilience that is evident in a minority of organisms, responders but not in non-responders, exposed to the same stressor. Inducible genomic plasticity may be implicated in natural resilience to ESE.

      "title": "Characterization of Spacesuit Associated Microbial Communities and Their Implications for NASA Missions.",
      "description": "Background: Crewed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) missions to other solar system bodies are currently being planned. One high-profile scientific focus during such expeditions would be life detection, specifically the discovery of past or present microbial life, if they exist. However, both humans and associated objects typically carry a high microbial burden. Thus, it is essential to distinguish between microbes brought with the expedition and those present on the exploring planets. Modern spacesuits are unique, customized spacecraft which provide protection, mobility and life support to crew during spacewalks, yet they vent, and the mobility of microbes through spacesuits has not been studied. Results:To evaluate the microbial colonization of spacesuits, NASA used an Extravehicular Activity swab kit to examine viable microbial populations of 48 samples from spacesuits using both traditional microbiological methods and molecular sequencing methods. The cultivable microbial population ranged from below the detection limit to 9 Ã 10^2 colony forming units per 25 cm^2 of sample and also significantly varied by the location. The cultivable microbial diversity was dominated by members of Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Ascomycota. However, 16S rRNA-based viable bacterial burden ranged from 10^5 to 10^6 copies per 25 cm^2 of sample. Shotgun metagenome sequencing revealed the presence of a diverse microbial population on the spacesuit surfaces, including Curtobacterium and Methylobacterium from across all sets of spacesuits in high abundance. Among bacterial species identified, higher abundance of Cutibacterium acnes, Methylobacterium oryzae, and M. phyllosphaerae reads were documented. Conclusion:The results of this study provide evidence that identical microbial strains may live on the wrist joint, inner gauntlet, and outer gauntlet of spacesuits. This raises the possibility, but does not confirm that microbial contaminants on the outside of the suits could contaminate planetary science operations unless additional measures are taken. Overall, these data provide the first estimate of microbial distribution associated with spacesuit surfaces, which will help future mission planners develop effective planetary protection strategies.",

      "title": "37-Day microgravity exposure in 16-Week female C57BL/6J mice during the NASA Rodent Research 1 mission is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites (femur and vertebrae, micro computed tomography)",
      "description": "Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity. This study derives results from femur and vertebrae using the micro computed tomography assay.",

      "description": "A wastewater treatment architecture with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor and a phototrophic membrane bioreactor was created to close resource loops for use on the Moon and Mars. During an anomaly, an increase of carbon-to-nitrogen ratio led to a shift in the microbial community within PMBR photomembrane bioreactor (PMBR). It is imperative to understand failure modes of the system and the systemâs ability to respond to perturbations in treatment because of their proposed application in remote, resource-limited locations. During this transient event, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the AnMBR permeate increased from 0.341 to 11.2. Results showed that the microbial community became more diverse during the event and enriched in species related to the remediation of aromatic compounds. The community shift led to conditions required for greater than 90% carbon removal by the PMBR. The inclusion of the PMBR in the treatment architecture increased resilience and robustness for treating high-strength wastewaters in extreme environments.",

      "description": "Exploiting the symbiotic interaction between crops and nitrogen-fixing bacteria is a simple and ecological method to promote plant growth in prospective extraterrestrial human outposts. In this study, we performed an RNA-seq analysis to investigate the adaptation of the legume symbiont Paraburkholderia phymatum STM815^T to simulated microgravity (s0-g) at the transcriptome level. The results revealed a drastic effect on gene expression, with roughly 23% of P. phymatum genes being differentially regulated in s0-g. Among those, 951 genes were upregulated and 858 downregulated in the cells grown in s0-g compared to terrestrial gravity (1âg). Several genes involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover or chaperones encoding were upregulated in s0-g, while those involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biosynthesis, motility or inorganic ions transport were downregulated. Specifically, the whole phm gene cluster, previously bioinformatically predicted to be involved in the production of a hypothetical malleobactin-like siderophore, phymabactin, was 20-fold downregulated in microgravity. By constructing a mutant strain (delta phmJK) we confirmed that the phm gene cluster codes for the only siderophore secreted by P. phymatum as assessed by the complete lack of iron chelating activity of the P. phymatum delta phmJK mutant on chrome azurol S (CAS) agar plates.

Previously, we reported upregulation of genes associated with cardiac proliferation in cardiac progenitors derived from hiPSCs that were exposed to space microgravity for 3 days. Here we investigated the effect of long-term exposure of hiPSC-cardiac progenitors to space microgravity on global gene expression. Cryopreserved 3D hiPSC-cardiac progenitors were sent to the International Space Station (ISS) and cultured for 3 weeks under ISS microgravity and ISS 1âG conditions. RNA-sequencing analyses revealed upregulation of genes associated with cardiac differentiation, proliferation, and cardiac structure/function and downregulation of genes associated with extracellular matrix regulation in the ISS microgravity cultures compared with the ISS 1âG cultures. Gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes mapping identified the upregulation of biological processes, molecular function, cellular components, and pathways associated with cell cycle, cardiac differentiation, and cardiac function. Taking together, these results suggest that space microgravity has a beneficial effect on the differentiation and growth of cardiac progenitors.",

Human NK cells were cultured for 48âh under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sÎ¼G), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sÎ¼G. This brief exposure to sÎ¼G markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sÎ¼G. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sÎ¼G reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that Î¼G may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.",

      "description": "The effects of galactic cosmic radiation on reproductive physiology remain largely unknown. We determined the impact of near-continuous low-dose-rate Californium-252 neutron irradiation (1 mGy/day) as a space-relevant analog on litter size and number of resorptions at embryonic day (E) 12.5 (nâ equals 19 radiated dams, nâ equals â20 controls) and litter size, number of resorptions, fetal growth, and placental signaling and transcriptome (RNA sequencing) at E18.5 (nâ equals â21 radiated dams, nâ equals â20 controls) in pregnant mice. A significantly increased early resorption rate and decreased placental weight were observed in irradiated mice. There were no statistically significant differences in litter size, fetal weight, length, or malformation rate between the groups. Near-continuous radiation had no significant effects on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), endoplasmic reticulum stress or inflammatory signaling, rate of double-stranded DNA breaks, and had minimal effects on gene expression in the placenta. These data suggest that near-continuous, low-level galactic cosmic radiation has a limited impact on pregnancy outcomes.",

      "description": "The space environment astronauts experience during space missions consists of multiple environmental challenges, including microgravity. In this study, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performances of male Fisher rats 2 months after sham irradiation or total body irradiation with photons in the absence or presence of simulated microgravity. We analyzed the plasma collected 9 months after sham irradiation or total body irradiation for distinct alterations in metabolic pathways and to determine whether changes to metabolic measures were associated with specific behavioral and cognitive measures. A total of 344 male Fischer rats were irradiated with photons (6 MeV; 3, 8, or 10 Gy) in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness achieved using hindlimb unloading (HU). To identify potential plasma biomarkers of photon radiation exposure or the HU condition for behavioral or cognitive performance, we performed regression analyses. The behavioral effects of HU on activity levels in an open field, measures of anxiety in an elevated plus maze, and anhedonia in the MandM consumption test were more pronounced than those of photon irradiation. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism and biosynthesis showed very strong pathway changes, following photon irradiation and HU in animals irradiated with 3 Gy. Here, 29 out of 101 plasma metabolites were associated with 1 out of 13 behavioral measures. In the absence of HU, 22 metabolites were related to behavioral and cognitive measures. In HU animals that were sham-irradiated or irradiated with 8 Gy, one metabolite was related to behavioral and cognitive measures. In HU animals irradiated with 3 Gy, six metabolites were related to behavioral and cognitive measures. These data suggest that it will be possible to develop stable plasma biomarkers of behavioral and cognitive performance, following environmental challenges like HU and radiation exposure. This study derives results from the Open Field, Novel Object Recognition and Anhedonia, and Elevated Plus Maze behavior assays.",

      "description": "Effects and interactions between different spaceflight stressors are expected to be experienced by crew on missions when exposed to microgravity and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). One of the limitations of previous studies on simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) is that a control HU condition was not included. We characterized the behavioral performance of male Fischer rats 2 months after sham or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion 6-mixed-beam exposure representative of GCRs in the absence or presence of HU. Six months later, the plasma, hippocampus, and cortex were processed to determine whether the behavioral effects were associated with long-term alterations in the metabolic pathways. In the open field without and with objects, interactions were observed for radiation Ã HU. In the plasma of animals that were not under the HU or control HU condition, the riboflavin metabolic pathway was affected most for sham irradiation vs. 0.75 Gy exposure. Analysis of the effects of control HU on plasma in the sham-irradiated animals showed that the alanine, aspartate, glutamate, riboflavin, and glutamine metabolisms as well as arginine biosynthesis were affected. The effects of control HU on the hippocampus in the sham-irradiated animals showed that the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan pathway was affected the most. Analysis of effects of 0.75 Gy irradiation on the cortex of control HU animals showed that the glutamine and glutamate metabolic pathway was affected similar to the hippocampus, while the riboflavin pathway was affected in animals that were not under the control HU condition. The effects of control HU on the cortex in sham-irradiated animals showed that the riboflavin metabolic pathway was affected. Animals receiving 0.75 Gy of irradiation showed impaired glutamine and glutamate metabolic pathway, whereas animals receiving 1.5 Gy of irradiation showed impaired riboflavin metabolic pathways. A total of 21 plasma metabolites were correlated with the behavioral measures, indicating that plasma and brain biomarkers associated with behavioral performance are dependent on the environmental conditions experienced.

The effects found (inhibiting) are very probably caused by excess toxic materials or competition of non-essential elements with essential elements rather than pH changes because previously pH has been found- to have relatively little effect over a wide range. Any stimulatory effect of the simulated lunar soil will probably appear at concentrations below those used in these experiments. If this is the case, the method is much less wasteful of mineral materials than methods in which pre-grown callus is treated with mineral materials.  Measurements of uptake of minerals will be difficult in this system because of the relatively small growth obtainable from the tissue and also because of the apparently large background of minerals contributed by the purified agar.",

      "description": "Research conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO) has shown the effects of microgravity on multiple organs. To investigate the effects of microgravity on the central nervous system, we developed a unique organoid strategy for modeling specific regions of the brain that are affected by neurodegenerative diseases. We generated 3-dimensional human neural organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from individuals affected by primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and non-symptomatic controls, by differentiating them toward cortical and dopaminergic fates, respectively, and combined them with isogenic microglia. The organoids were cultured for a month using a novel sealed cryovial culture method on the International Space Station (ISS) and a parallel set that remained on Earth. Live samples were returned to Earth for analysis by RNA expression and histology and were attached to culture dishes to enable neurite outgrowth. Our results show that both cortical and dopaminergic organoids cultured in LEO had lower levels of genes associated with cell proliferation and higher levels of maturation-associated genes, suggesting that the cells matured more quickly in LEO. This study is continuing with several more missions in order to understand the mechanisms underlying accelerated maturation and to investigate other neurological diseases. Our goal is to make use of the opportunity to study neural cells in LEO to better understand and treat neurodegenerative disease on Earth and to help ameliorate potentially adverse neurological effects of space travel. This study hosts data from cortical organoids. Data for the dopaminergic organoids is available under OSD-871.",

      "description": "With technological advancements, human's desire to explore space is growing and more people are staying longer at the international space station (ISS). The impact of microgravity on stem cells (SC) is not fully understood. We explored the impact of microgravity on gene expression profile of cultured mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) at the ISS. We also evaluated how the new knowledge gained sheds light on our understanding of human physiology on Earth. Primary cultures of MSCs were expanded at the ISS for 1 or 2 weeks and mRNA was isolated from samples of the cultured cells. Gene expression profiles were determined and compared with samples from real-time ground control cultures. Differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analysis and determination of key genes were performed that revealed for the first time the existence of potential 'master regulators' coordinating a systemic response to microgravity. Cyclin D1 (CCND1), a protein-coding gene that regulates cell cycle progression and CDK kinases, was identified as the most connected regulator at week 1. Further analysis showed the impacted genes from cultured MSCs significantly correlated with known gene pathways associated with cell division, chromosomal segregation and nuclear division, extracellular matrix structure and organization, muscle apoptosis and differentiation. This study exemplifies the utility of space research to advance our understanding of human physiology both on Earth and in space. To investigate the effects of microgravity on MSC growth and understand the differences in gene expression profiles between microgravity and ground control environments, two groups of MSC were sent to the ISS.

The cells were then preserved and transferred back to the laboratory. Further Gene expression profiles were compared between samples to identify differentially expressed genes.",

      "description": "Research conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO) has shown the effects of microgravity on multiple organs. To investigate the effects of microgravity on the central nervous system, we developed a unique organoid strategy for modeling specific regions of the brain that are affected by neurodegenerative diseases. We generated 3-dimensional human neural organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from individuals affected by primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and non-symptomatic controls, by differentiating them toward cortical and dopaminergic fates, respectively, and combined them with isogenic microglia. The organoids were cultured for a month using a novel sealed cryovial culture method on the International Space Station (ISS) and a parallel set that remained on Earth. Live samples were returned to Earth for analysis by RNA expression and histology and were attached to culture dishes to enable neurite outgrowth. Our results show that both cortical and dopaminergic organoids cultured in LEO had lower levels of genes associated with cell proliferation and higher levels of maturation-associated genes, suggesting that the cells matured more quickly in LEO. This study is continuing with several more missions in order to understand the mechanisms underlying accelerated maturation and to investigate other neurological diseases. Our goal is to make use of the opportunity to study neural cells in LEO to better understand and treat neurodegenerative disease on Earth and to help ameliorate potentially adverse neurological effects of space travel. This study hosts data from dopaminergic organoids. Data for the cortical organoids is available under OSD-863.",

      "description": "Muscle atrophy is a morbidity and mortality risk factor that happens with disuse, chronic disease, and ageing. Recovery from atrophy involves changes in protein synthesis and different cell types such as muscle fibers, and satellite and immune cells. Here we show that the previously uncharacterized gene and protein Zfp697 is a damage-induced regulator of muscle regeneration. Zfp697/ZNF697 expression is transiently elevated during recovery from muscle atrophy or injury in mice and humans. Sustained Zfp697 expression in mouse muscle leads to a gene expression signature of chemokine secretion, immune cell recruitment, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Myofiber-specific Zfp697 ablation hinders the inflammatory and regenerative response to muscle injury, compromising functional recovery. We uncover Zfp697 as an essential mediator of the interferon gamma response in muscle cells that functions primarily as an ncRNA-binding protein, most notably the pro-regenerative miR-206. This work identifies Zfp697 as an integrator of cell-cell communication necessary for tissue regeneration. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for mouse gastrocnemius muscle from model of hindlimb unloading/reloading comparing wild-type and Zfp697 conditional skeletal muscle knockout (mKO) animals. Control mice were kept in conventional cages throughout the entire protocol. Experiment was performed in three replicates per condition.",
